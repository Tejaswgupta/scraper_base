    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars. It’s vital for the public, law students, and the legal community to understand the rights and provisions governing leases. Sections 105 to 117 of Transfer of Property Act outline these aspects, and this article focuses on key sections to provide a clear and basic understanding of lease agreements."

Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars. It’s vital for the public, law students, and the legal community to understand the rights and provisions governing leases. Sections 105 to 117 of Transfer of Property Act outline these aspects, and this article focuses on key sections to provide a clear and basic understanding of lease agreements."

Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars. It’s vital for the public, law students, and the legal community to understand the rights and provisions governing leases. Sections 105 to 117 of Transfer of Property Act outline these aspects, and this article focuses on key sections to provide a clear and basic understanding of lease agreements."

The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property.

Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property.

Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice.

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars. It’s vital for the public, law students, and the legal community to understand the rights and provisions governing leases.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars. It’s vital for the public, law students, and the legal community to understand the rights and provisions governing leases. Sections 105 to 117 of Transfer of Property Act outline these aspects, and this article focuses on key sections to provide a clear and basic understanding of lease agreements."

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars. It’s vital for the public, law students, and the legal community to understand the rights and provisions governing leases. Sections 105 to 117 of Transfer of Property Act outline these aspects, and this article focuses on key sections to provide a clear and basic understanding of lease agreements."

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars. It’s vital for the public, law students, and the legal community to understand the rights and provisions governing leases. Sections 105 to 117 of Transfer of Property Act outline these aspects, and this article focuses on key sections to provide a clear and basic understanding of lease agreements."

Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars. It’s vital for the public, law students, and the legal community to understand the rights and provisions governing leases. Sections 105 to 117 of Transfer of Property Act outline these aspects, and this article focuses on key sections to provide a clear and basic understanding of lease agreements."

Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars. It’s vital for the public, law students, and the legal community to understand the rights and provisions governing leases. Sections 105 to 117 of Transfer of Property Act outline these aspects, and this article focuses on key sections to provide a clear and basic understanding of lease agreements."

The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property.

Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property.

Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice.

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars. It’s vital for the public, law students, and the legal community to understand the rights and provisions governing leases.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars.

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "

    "headline": "Notes on Article 14 of the Indian Constitution",
    "data": " Introduction Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all individuals within the territory of India. It forms the bedrock of the Indian legal system and ensures that no person is discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, or place of birth.Article 14 is located in Part III of the Indian Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. It is a part of the larger set of rights aimed at ensuring social, economic, and political justice to all citizens of India.Article 14 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution states, “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth”.Equal Protection of Laws and Equality Before LawThis concept mandates that the state must apply the law equally and impartially to all individuals. It means that similarly situated individuals should be treated alike under the law without any arbitrary or unjust distinctions.The principle of reasonable classification is also associated with equal protection. It allows the state to classify individuals into different groups for specific purposes, as long as the classification is rational, based on intelligible differentia, and has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.This principle ensures that all individuals, irrespective of their social or economic status, are equal in the eyes of the law. No person can claim special privileges or be subjected to unfair treatment by the state or its agencies.It prevents discrimination and ensures that every citizen, regardless of their background, has equal access to justice and legal remedies.Scope and Applicability of Article 14Article 14 applies to all persons, whether citizens or non-citizens, within the territory of India. It covers individuals as well as artificial persons such as corporations and other entities.It applies to all laws and state actions, including legislative, executive, and judicial actions. Even the private actions of state officials or public authorities are covered under this article.The right to equality does not prohibit the state from making classifications. These classifications are allowed if they are reasonable and have a rational nexus with the objective of the law.Article 14 permits reasonable classification to meet certain objectives. However, the classification should not be discriminatory or arbitrary. Some factors that the courts have considered while evaluating the reasonableness of classification include intelligible differentia, rational nexus, and the objective sought to be achieved.Certain laws, such as those related to taxation, may have a reasonable classification based on income levels, but they should not be discriminatory.Intelligible Differentia under Article 14Article 14 does not guarantee absolute uniformity in the treatment of all individuals. It allows for reasonable classifications based on intelligible differentia, ensuring fairness and justice without discriminatory treatment.Intelligible differentia is a crucial concept under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. It refers to the reasonable and logical basis for classifying individuals into distinct groups for the purpose of legislation. When a law creates a classification among people, there must be a rational and intelligible differentia that sets apart the members of one group from others.The differentia should be based on real and substantial differences between the groups, and these differences should have a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the law or state action.To pass the test of intelligible differentia, the classification made by a law must be reasonable and not arbitrary. The classification should have a rational basis/reasonable nexus to the object of such legislation.Role of Judiciary in Article 14The Indian judiciary plays a vital role in upholding the right to equality. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that laws and state actions conform to the principles enshrined in Article 14.The judiciary has interpreted and expanded the scope of equality to include the concept of substantive equality, which seeks to address historical disadvantages and ensure equitable outcomes.Affirmative action measures, such as reservations in educational institutions and government jobs for socially and educationally backward classes, have been upheld by the courts under the ambit of Article 14ConclusionArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution is a cornerstone of the nation’s commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It ensures that the state treats all individuals fairly and equally under the law, irrespective of their background.It guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of laws. It ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and no arbitrary or discriminatory classification is made."

    "headline": "Actionable Claim and Transfer of Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionThe code of contract with respect to the law of property was completed with the enactment of the Transfer of Property Act in the year 1882 (‘ToPA’). It codified the laws pertaining to the transfer of property. However, TOPA does not cover all kinds of properties and their transfer. An actionable claim represents a legal right that can be the subject of a lawsuit, and the transfer of actionable claims involves the assignment of these rights from one party to another. This post deals with actionable claim and their transferability under the Transfer of Property Act.Actionable Claim under Transfer of Property ActThe term “Actionable Claim” is a legal concept that is defined under Section 3 of the Transfer of the Property Act. According to said provision, an actionable claim means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of moveable property, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the claimant, which the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing confidential or contingent.Thus, as per the aforesaid provision, an actionable claim is a claim to:i) any unsecured debt, orii) any beneficial interest in a movable property that is not in the claimant’s possession, either actual or constructive.Apart from aforesaid types of claims, there are other kinds of claims as well that are actionable in nature and can afford relief. However, several kinds of claims are not actionable claims as per the definition enumerated under the TOPA, and therefore, they cannot be transferred. For instance, in Jugal Kishore Saraf v. Raw Cotton Limited, the Apex Court found that since the action is necessary in case of a decree or a judgment debt, it cannot be termed as an actionable claim.In the case of Moti Lal v. Radhey Law, the Apex Court held that the right of claiming damages, whether it arises out of contract or un-liquidated damages arising out of tortuous liability, cannot be regarded as an actionable claim. This is undoubtedly an obligation but does not amount to unsecured debt. It is attributable to the uncertain sum of money involved. Furthermore, it is also not a part of an original transaction, which is a must for a claim to become actionable. However, it includes the principal money and the interest charged thereupon for them being a specific nature of the debt. On the other hand, damages are of an uncertain nature and, therefore, not an actionable claim.Similarly, in Jai Narayan v. Kishun Dutta, the Court found that mesne profit cannot be regarded as an actionable claim as it is un-liquidated in nature. Further, it is neither a claim to a beneficial interest in movable property. Thus, it is a “mere right to sue“.Moreover, rights under trademark, patent and copyright are also not termed as actionable claims. This is due to the fact that they already vest in the individual who possesses them. They are the individual’s intellectual property, and hence, another person cannot be permitted to claim under them. They are governable under their respective legislation and cannot be transferred as actionable claims.Transfer of Actionable Claim Since an actionable claim is not considered “property” under the TOPA, it cannot be transferred in the same way that property can be transferred. Sections 130 to 137 of Chapter VIII of the TOPA deal with the transfer of actionable claims. This Chapter provides general principles that must be borne in mind while transferring actionable claims. The provisions are analysed hereinunder. This section states that an actionable claim can be transferred:i) with or without considerationii) by way of an instrument in writing duly signed by the transferor or his agent duly authorised in this respect.Thus, oral transfer of actionable claims is not permitted. However, its registration is not necessary, and no separate instrument of transfer is to be effected.The notice is not necessary to ensure perfection of the transferee’s title of actionable claim. However, the dealings of the debtor with the creditor are protected until the former receives the notice of such an assignment in observance of the conditions enumerate under Section 131 of the TOPA. It states that:i) The notice of transfer of the actionable claim has to be made in writing.ii) It must be signed by the transferor or his agent authorised on his behalf.iii) However, if the transferor refuses to sign it, then, in that case, it must be signed by the transferee of actionable claim or his duly authorised agent.The Hon’ble Apex Court has clarified in Sadasook Ramprotap v. Hoar Miller & Co. that Section 131 of TOPA does not prescribe any time limit for the service of notice. It must be within a reasonable period of time and unconditional.The principle behind this section is that the transferee gets no better title than the transferor. Thus, the transferee takes all the equities and also the liabilities of the transferor to which the latter was subject at the time of such assignment.This provision deals with the warranty of solvency of debtor. In the case of assignment of a debt, the transferee runs the risk of losing the claim when the debtor becomes insolvent. Therefore, as a precaution, the transferor of the actionable claim warrants the solvency of the debtor at the date of assignment. But this is subject to contract to the contrary. Further, it is limited only to the amount or value of the consideration for which it is transferred.Since an actionable claim is a property, its transfer by way of a mortgage is possible. When one debt is transferred to cover an other debt, whether existent debt or future debt, it is referred to as a transfer of actionable claim by way of a mortgage. This section provides the below-mentioned preposition under which the amount so realised could be appropriated:i) the debt received by the transferor or recovered by the transferee is to be applied in payment of the cost of such recovery.ii) it is to be applied towards satisfaction of the amount secured by the transfer.iii) if any residue remains after the above-mentioned payments, the remainder is to be given to the transferor.This provision was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1944. It states that the asignee of fire insurance policy in whom the property of the subject matter of policy is absolutely vested at the date of assignment, it would have the effect of transferring and vesting in him all the rights to sue just as if the insurance policy was entered into by him.The persons mentioned under this section are not legally qualified to make transfers of actionable claims. The object behind this disqualification of “Judges, legal practitioners and officers connected with Courts of Justice” is to ensure that the judiciary remains impartial. Furthermore, this Chapter is not applicable to negotiable instruments and other instruments mentioned thereunder. This is because they are governed by other laws and statutes.ConclusionAfter studying every relevant provision of the TOPA it can indeed be concluded that actionable claims as defined under Section 3 of the TOPA are transferable in nature. It is a movable property of intangible nature that could be assigned as per the provisions and rules mentioned in Chapter VIII of the TOPA. Thus, one must be evident as to the nature of the property, the process of transfer of the actionable claim and the law laid down under various judgements of the Indian courts to effectuate a valid transfer of actionable claim.For more such notes on Transfer of Property Act, click here!"

    "headline": "9 Landmark Cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024",
    "data": "Here’s a list of 9 landmark cases on Tort Law for CLAT PG 2024!Kasturi Lal v State of UP: This case dealt with the vicarious liability of the state.SC held that State will not be liable in case of the exercise of sovereign powers. This is not considered to be the right judgement now.Bird v Jones: Jones prohibited the plaintiff from moving in the direction he wished to go. Plaintiff was free to remain where he was, or move in any other direction but the one direction obstructed by Defendant. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for false imprisonment. It was held that since the plaintiff was allowed to move in all other directions, it doesn’t amount to false imprisonment. To amount to false imprisonment, the plaintiff must be confined to some boundary of sorts.Perera v.Vandiyar: This case deals with tresspass. The Court held that going beyond the purpose for which a person has entered the land would amount to trespass. In this case, the tenant hadn’t paid rent and the landlord cut off gas and electricity supply. This was a breach in covenant, however, it did not amount to trespass as he did not venture into the leased premises.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati: The Supreme Court held that the state must be equally liable as other companies for the acts of its employees. The concept of sovereign immunity and the rule of ‘King can do no Wrong’ are no longer applicable.Dixon v. Holden: Defamation, in this case, was defined as an injury to a man’s reputation. The Court stated that, “A man’s reputation is his property, and if, possible, more valuable, than other property”.Abrath v. North Eastern Railway: The Court laid down 3 principles necessary to form a reasonable and probable cause to prosecute:1. Person complaining took due care to be informed of the facts 2. He honestly believed his allegations to be true 3. The facts were such as to constitute prima facie evidence.Hicks v. Faulker: If the defendant has honestly and bona fide instituted the prosecution, he is not liable even though due to a defective memory, he had forgotten the true facts and has gone on with the prosecution.Adam v. Ward: This case dealt with qualified privilege. It was held that a privileged occasion in one where the person who makes a communication has an interest/duty to make such communication and the person to whom it is made has an interest to receive.Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspaper Ltd: Mr. Cassidy didn’t share a house with his wife but he visited her occasionally. The newspaper published his picture stating that his engagement had been fixed with a certain woman. This was held to be defamatory as it reflected poorly on Mr. Cassidy’s wife by insinuating that she was perhaps his mistress. The Court held that the innuendo had been established and the innocence of the defendant was not a valid defence."

    "headline": "Trial by Media in India: Effect on Judiciary, Democracy and Society",
    "data": " IntroductionTrial by media refers to the phenomenon where the media plays a significant role in influencing public opinion about a legal case before it reaches the court or during its trial. In India, the media has become a powerful entity capable of shaping public perception and affecting the course of justice. While the media serves as a crucial watchdog, ensuring transparency and accountability, the concept of trial by media raises concerns about the impact on fair and impartial judicial proceedings.Role of Media in Shaping Public OpinionThe media, particularly television and social media, has the ability to reach a vast audience quickly. Media framing involves the way news stories are presented, emphasizing certain aspects and downplaying others. The framing of an issue can shape public perceptions and influence how individuals interpret events.This power can be harnessed to inform the public about legal cases, but it also opens the door to sensationalism and biased reporting. Sensational headlines and dramatic narratives can create a prejudiced atmosphere, making it challenging for the accused to receive a fair trial.In recent times there have been numerous instances in which the media has conducted the trial of an accused and has passed the verdict even before the court passes its judgement.Continuous exposure to certain narratives, themes, or images through the media can shape and reinforce public attitudes. This influence extends to attitudes towards political figures, social issues, and cultural phenomena.Implications of Trial by Media on Judicial IndependenceTrial by media can have profound implications for judicial independence, a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. Judicial independence is the concept that judges should be free from external pressures and influences, ensuring impartiality, fairness, and the faithful application of the law.When media coverage becomes pervasive and sensational, several implications arise. Trial by media can create an atmosphere in which fair trials become increasingly difficult. The media’s portrayal of a case may lead to preconceived notions about guilt or innocence.If the public perceives that the judiciary is swayed by media narratives, it can erode confidence in the legal system. Maintaining public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of the judiciary, and trial by media can undermine this trust.Sensational media coverage can also contribute to public pressure for swift justice, potentially leading to calls for harsher sentences or even vigilantism. This puts additional pressure on the judiciary to respond to public sentiment rather than adhere to due process.The challenge lies in finding a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.Media Ethics and ResponsibilityMedia ethics and responsibility are critical considerations, especially in the context of trial by media, where the media’s role can significantly impact the fairness of legal proceedings. Ethical journalism ensures that reporting is balanced, accurate, and respects the principles of justice.Balancing the right to information with the rights of victims and the accused is crucial. Journalists should exercise sensitivity and respect privacy laws to avoid causing harm or hindering the legal process.Social media can amplify the impact of trial by media. Journalists should verify information before sharing it on social platforms, where misinformation can spread rapidly. Media outlets can contribute to media literacy by providing context, explaining legal processes, and fostering an understanding of the complexities involved in legal cases. Informed citizens are better equipped to critically assess media coverage.Trial by Media and Kangaroo CourtsFormer Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had said last year that “rising number of media trials” are proving to be hurdles towards doing justice, and “kangaroo courts” run by the media are causing harm to the health of the democracy.A “kangaroo court” is a term used to describe a judicial or quasi-judicial process that lacks fairness, impartiality, and adherence to legal standards. It implies a court or tribunal that operates with a semblance of legality but is characterized by a disregard for due process, the rule of law, and fundamental principles of justice.Kangaroo courts often lack impartiality, meaning that the individuals presiding over the proceedings have preconceived notions or biases that may affect the outcome. This bias could be based on political, social, or personal considerations.Effect of Trial by Media on DemocracyThe effect of trial by media on democracy can be complex and multifaceted, as media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, influencing political discourse, and contributing to the functioning of a democratic society.Trial by media can shape public perceptions of individuals and events, influencing public opinion before legal processes are complete. This influence can impact political figures, public figures, and even government policies, potentially swaying public sentiment in a way that may not align with fair and unbiased judicial outcomes.When media coverage sensationalizes legal cases or contributes to a perception of biased reporting, it can erode public trust in institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement. Trust in these institutions is crucial for a healthy democracy.Laws Regarding Trial by Media in IndiaIn India, there are several laws and legal principles that relate to the issue of trial by media, recognizing the importance of ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, empowers the judiciary to take action against publications that scandalize or tend to scandalize the courts. Reporting that interferes with the administration of justice or prejudices ongoing legal proceedings can be held in contempt.The law of defamation can be invoked if media coverage involves false statements that harm the reputation of individuals. However, truth is generally a defense against defamation claims, and public figures may have to meet a higher standard to prove defamation.Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated by the media can seek legal remedies such as filing defamation suits or approaching the appropriate authorities for actions that violate their rights.ConclusionNavigating the complexities of trial by media in India demands a holistic approach that addresses the responsibilities of both the media and the legal system. Striking a balance between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial is imperative for upholding the principles of justice in a democratic society. Through ethical journalism, self-regulation, and, when necessary, legal measures, India can foster an environment where the media acts as a responsible guardian of democracy without compromising the sanctity of legal processes."

    "headline": "Understanding Lease under Transfer of Property Act: Definition, Formation and Detailed Provisions",
    "data": " Understanding LeaseA lease is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of renting property, ensuring the tenant’s use of the property in exchange for regular payments to the landlord. These terms typically include the property’s address, rent amount, security deposit, rent due date, lease duration, pet policies, and consequences for breaching the contract. Residential leases often have standard terms for all tenants, while commercial leases are more negotiable and can span from one to 10 years, depending on the tenant’s specific needs.Lease under Transfer of Property Act is defined under Section 105 as the temporary transfer of real property for an agreed-upon consideration, with the recipient accepting the terms of the arrangement.Essentials of a Lease under Transfer of Property ActCompetent Parties: Both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the lessor must hold undisputed property rights.Right of Possession: A lease only transfers possession of the property, not ownership rights.Rent Options: Consideration for the lease can come in the form of rent or a premium.Lessee Acceptance: The lessee must accept the lease terms, including the specified time period and conditions.Defined Time Period: A lease always has a specified duration, which can be adjusted at the lessor’s discretion.Creating a Valid LeaseSection 107 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act outlines the requirements for creating a valid lease of immovable property. It specifies the following conditions:In summary, the process of making a lease depends on the type and duration of the lease, with some leases requiring registration and others permitting oral agreements, subject to the State Government’s discretion. Proper documentation and compliance with these legal requirements are crucial to creating a valid lease of immovable property in India.Detailed Provisions for Lease of Immovable PropertySpecifies the default duration of leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes and other purposes when there is no written contract or local law to the contrary.Lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes is deemed year-to-year, terminable with a six-month notice, and for other purposes, it’s month-to-month, terminable with a 15-day notice.The notice period commences from the date of receipt.Shorter notice periods may not invalidate the notice when a suit or proceeding is filed after the notice period.If a lease specifies a particular day as the starting point, that day is excluded when calculating the lease duration.When no commencement day is mentioned, the lease begins from the date of making the lease.Lists conditions under which a lease can end, including the passage of time, the happening of specified events, surrender, implied surrender, forfeiture, and notice to determine the lease.Explains that a forfeiture due to breach can be waived by certain actions of the lessor, provided they are aware of the forfeiture.Discusses how a notice to quit can be waived by the person giving it with the express or implied consent of the recipient.Provides an option for lessees to avoid ejectment in cases of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by paying rent arrears, interest, and full costs of the suit or providing sufficient security within a specified time.Specifies that surrender, whether express or implied, of a lease does not affect under-leases granted by the lessee with substantially similar terms, except for rent, unless the surrender is made to obtain a new lease. Rent and contracts of under-lessees become payable to and enforceable by the lessor.States that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act related to leases do not apply to agricultural leases, except if the State Government, through a published notification, makes specific provisions applicable, either in full or with modifications, after six months from the notification’s publication.Leases are a common part of daily life, involving agreements for renting property or assets such as houses or cars. It’s vital for the public, law students, and the legal community to understand the rights and provisions governing leases. Sections 105 to 117 of Transfer of Property Act outline these aspects, and this article focuses on key sections to provide a clear and basic understanding of lease agreements."

    "headline": "Copyright Issues in the Digital Era: Challenges and Solutions",
    "data": " IntroductionThe digital era has revolutionized content creation, distribution, and consumption, enabling global creativity while introducing new challenges in safeguarding intellectual property. As digital platforms democratize content generation, they concurrently amplify concerns about unauthorized replication and distribution. Copyright issues in the digital era have become increasingly complex over the years due to the ease of copying and distributing digital content.The rapid dissemination of content through social media, streaming services, and sharing platforms has outpaced traditional copyright enforcement, prompting the need for innovative solutions that balance creative expression, fair use, and creators’ rights within the dynamic landscape of digital copyright.Challenges faced by Copyright in Digital EraNavigating the digital age has ushered in a transformative era for copyright protection, accompanied by intricate challenges surrounding content ownership and dissemination. The proliferation of digital technology has undeniably facilitated effortless copying and distribution of creative works, effectively blurring the lines of traditional copyright boundaries.While the accessibility and democratization of content creation are positive outcomes, they’ve engendered a formidable conundrum: tracing the pathways of content utilization across the expansive online landscape has grown exceedingly complex.Establishing clear ownership for digital creations, in an environment where replication is effortless, has become a daunting task. The intricacies are exacerbated by the multifaceted nature of the internet, rendering the enforcement of copyright a formidable and costly undertaking due to the sheer volume of content and the challenges of jurisdiction in a global context.Moreover, the digital realm poses distinct challenges to delineating the bounds of fair use, given the transformative potential of creative content in this medium. User-generated platforms, while offering dynamic outlets for creativity, simultaneously introduce layers of complexity to the concept of copyright ownership.In essence, the digital age has expanded access to an unprecedented extent, revolutionizing the creative landscape. Yet, this expansion has simultaneously evoked pressing questions concerning copyright norms and ownership paradigms, urging us to reflect upon and adapt to the intricacies of a digital world that fundamentally redefines the landscape of creativity and its protection.Analyzing Digital Copyright in IndiaWithin the dynamic digital landscape, India’s Copyright Act of 1957 has undergone a series of transformative adaptations to effectively address the unique challenges presented by the digital era.This legal framework, originally established to safeguard creators’ intellectual property rights, has been continuously refined to ensure its relevance and efficacy in a world increasingly defined by digital content creation, distribution, and consumption.One of the most pivotal updates to India’s copyright protection regime occurred through the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. This amendment responded to the shifting paradigms of the digital age by aligning India’s copyright legislation with international agreements such as the World Copyright Treaty of 1996 and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty of 1996. By doing so, the Act extended its protective umbrella to encompass the rapidly expanding realm of digital works, an area previously uncharted by copyright law.The Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012 introduced a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the distinctive challenges posed by the digital landscape. These provisions included penalties aimed at curbing copyright infringement, particularly in the digital sphere.Moreover, the amendment addressed the intricacies of management information rights, delineating the responsibilities and liabilities of internet service providers to curb copyright violations on their platforms.To facilitate creative expression and innovation, the amendment also introduced statutory licenses for activities like cover versions and broadcasting, ensuring a balance between creators’ rights and public access to content.In line with these legal developments, Indian courts have played a critical role in shaping the landscape of digital copyright. The landmark case of UTV Software Communication Ltd v/s 1337x and others exemplifies this role. The court’s ruling upheld the principle that online copyright infringement carries the same weight as physical infringement, reaffirming that the digital realm is not exempt from copyright protections.This judicial perspective underscores the delicate balance that must be maintained between preserving the rights of creators and ensuring an open and accessible internet. It underscores the importance of delineating clear boundaries for digital content usage and enforcement within the unique context of India.The Future of Digital CopyrightIn response to the intricate copyright issues in the digital era, a range of solutions emerge:Digital Rights Management (DRM) curbs unauthorized content access and distribution; watermarking embeds identifiers to track digital material usage; copyright education fosters responsible consumption; international collaboration ensures consistent legal enforcement;Creative Commons licenses permit controlled sharing; blockchain technology tracks ownership and usage; collaborative content protection leverages stakeholders for comprehensive strategies; and clear fair use guidelines enable responsible use while respecting creators’ rights.Employing these measures collectively can fortify copyright protection, nurturing a digital landscape where creators’ rights are preserved, users are educated, and innovations are fostered.Looking forward, the trajectory of digital copyright is poised for significant changes encompassing legal adaptations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer behavior.Anticipated legal reforms could address emerging challenges such as AI generated content and cross-border distribution, while technologies like blockchain hold potential to revolutionize copyright management and transparency. As users become both creators and consumers, fostering responsible engagement with digital content through education and awareness campaigns becomes crucial.The collective effort of governments, industries, innovators, and consumers will shape a balanced digital copyright landscape that respects creators’ rights, encourages innovation, and promotes ethical content consumption.ConclusionThe evolution of India’s copyright framework within the digital era reflects the country’s commitment to adapting its legal landscape to the changing tides of technological advancement. This journey encompasses a delicate interplay between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a digital environment that promotes innovation, creativity, and equitable access to content.Copyright issues in digital era have arisen due to easy replication and distribution of content, demanding adaptable legal frameworks that balance creators’ rights and public access. International collaboration, updated laws, and digital literacy are pivotal for addressing these issues and cultivating a respectful and innovative digital ecosystem that upholds intellectual property rights."

    "headline": "Judicial Review in India: Evolution, Significance, and Contemporary Challenges",
    "data": " Introduction to Judicial ReviewThe verdict delivered by the Supreme Court of India in the Central Vista case signifies a profound milestone in the jurisprudential landscape, as it delves into the nuanced dimensions of judicial review with meticulous depth.Central to this adjudication is the Central Vista project, an ambitious endeavor encompassing an array of historic landmarks in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, the North and South Blocks, India Gate, and the National Archives.In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court’s decision to abstain from categorizing the Central Vista project as a subject demanding an exceptional or heightened form of judicial review carries significant implications. The essence of this position emanates from the Court’s assertion that the government retains the prerogative to exercise policy choices—whether culminating in success or lapses—within the confines of constitutional principles.The following article shall delve into the various aspects of the judicial review process in India.Need for Judicial Review in IndiaNavigating the Core Tenets of Judicial Review The crux of this legal discourse revolves around the fundamental doctrine of judicial review, which stands as the bedrock of the Indian constitutional framework. This intricate mechanism involves exhaustive scrutiny by the judiciary into the legality and constitutionality of decisions rendered by governmental entities.Notably, the purview of judicial review surpasses mere appraisal of the substantive merits of conclusions; it extends to an intricate analysis of the procedural integrity of the decision-making process itself.This complex structure is underpinned by two interwoven doctrines: “Procedure Established by Law” and “Due Process of Law. While the former emphasizes adherence to established legislative procedures, the latter elevates this concept by emphasizing that legality must be coupled with equity and justice in decision-making.Significance of Judicial ReviewThe significance of judicial review reverberates through the intricate tapestry of a democratic society, engaging in multifaceted roles that extend beyond its legal manifestation.Principally, it serves as a bastion of constitutional supremacy, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of governmental actions against the backdrop of the fundamental law of the land. Moreover, it functions as a vigilant guardian, preempting potential abuses of power by both the legislative and executive branches, thus preserving a delicate balance of authority.Beyond this, judicial review operates as a shield, safeguarding the rights of citizens from undue encroachments. This doctrine also upholds the federal structure of governance envisioned in the Constitution. By preserving the independence of the judiciary and curtailing any inclination towards executive overreach, judicial review becomes the bedrock upon which democratic ideals are anchored.Power of Judicial Review in IndiaThe arena of judicial review is a rich mosaic encompassing diverse dimensions, spanning studies of legislative actions, administrative decisions, and even assessments of past judicial pronouncements.In legislative measures, the judiciary rigorously examines the alignment of laws with constitutional principles. The Court assumes a custodial role within the administrative realm, ensuring that administrative bodies adhere scrupulously to constitutional tenets while exercising their powers.Furthermore, the framework of judicial review extends to the realm of judicial decisions, providing latitude for recalibration or revision of prior verdicts that may no longer resonate with established legal precedents or constitutional fundamentals.On the one hand, it acts as a shield against potential government overreach, preventing laws and policies from transgressing the sanctity of the Constitution. On the other hand, an excessively robust implementation could disrupt the seamless operation of governmental machinery and potentially supplant existing laws, thereby introducing a layer of governance-related challenges.Categories of Judicial Review in the Indian JudiciaryIn this category, the Indian judiciary exercises its authority to check laws and decisions made by the Legislature. The goal is to ensure that these laws and decisions align with constitutional provisions. This review is crucial to maintaining the balance of power and preventing any overreach by the legislative branch.Under this category, the courts have the power to examine the actions of administrative authorities. This examination focuses on administrative decisions’ legality, rationality, and legitimacy. Judicial review checks the executive branch’s activities, ensuring they are within the law’s bounds and in the public’s best interest.Within this category, judicial review involves rectifying inconsistencies in past court judgments. This process aims to enhance the coherence of legal principles and minimize conflicting interpretations. By addressing discrepancies, the judiciary contributes to the stability and predictability of the legal system.Judicial review also extends to assessing the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution. If a constitutional amendment violates the fundamental principles or the basic structure of the Constitution, the judiciary has the authority to declare it null and void.Constitutional Pillars and Legal Foundations of Judicial ReviewAlthough the Indian Constitution does not explicitly bestow courts with the authority to invalidate laws, it unmistakably delineates specific boundaries for each branch of government.Central articles, such as Article 13, which designates laws contravening fundamental rights as null and void, and Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts as guardians of fundamental rights, collectively form the bedrock upon which judicial review is erected.Additionally, Article 251, Article 254, Article 246(3), and Article 245 contribute to the intricate scaffold that bolsters the structure of judicial review.Explanation of the Constitutional Provisions Related to Judicial Review in IndiaArticle 13 establishes a fundamental principle that laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void to the extent of the inconsistency. This provision empowers the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate citizens’ fundamental rights.Article 32 is often called the “Right to Constitutional Remedies. It enables individuals to approach the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights directly. This provision ensures that citizens have an accessible avenue to seek redress when their rights are violated.These articles define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and empower it to hear disputes between the center and states and conflicts between states. The Supreme Court’s role in reviewing judgments passed by other bodies underscores its role as the highest interpreter of the Constitution.Article 143 grants the President the power to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on matters of public importance or legal issues. This provision establishes a mechanism for pursuing the judiciary’s guidance on complex issues.Articles 226 and 227 confer the High Courts with the power of judicial review. Article 226 allows the High Court to issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights and other purposes. Article 227 grants the High Courts the authority to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. Articles 245 and 246 delineate the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and the states. These articles empower the judiciary to review laws passed by both levels of government to ensure they adhere to the constitutional division of powers.These articles address situations where there are contradictions between state and union laws. The provision in Article 251 ensures that union laws prevail in inconsistencies, maintaining uniformity in some issues.Article 372 (1) extends the power of judicial review to laws that existed before the adoption of the Constitution, ensuring their continued scrutiny for constitutionality.Landmark Cases on Judicial Review in India As the protector of fundamental rights, the judiciary occupies a pivotal role, particularly in an era marked by the expanding realm of state functions. The augmented engagement of the Court in administrative decisions and their subsequent execution underscores the evolving nature of the judiciary’s role.However, a reasonable equilibrium must be maintained to preclude any unwarranted judicial activism that might infringe upon the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Striking this optimal balance among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches becomes paramount for upholding constitutional ideals.In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament couldn’t curtail fundamental rights through amendments, establishing that certain basic rights are beyond the reach of amendments.This case marked a turning point in Indian constitutional history. The Supreme Court introduced the concept of the “basic structure” doctrine, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its fundamental structure.The Supreme Court, in this case, struck a balance between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review. It held that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy its essential features.In these instances, the judiciary’s exercise of judicial review ensured the Constitution’s integrity, protected citizens’ rights, and maintained a harmonious balance between the three branches of government.Critique of the Judicial Review System in IndiaThe judicial review system in India, while playing a vital role in upholding the principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights, has faced criticism on several fronts.While the judicial review system in India serves as a crucial check on executive and legislative powers and protects citizens’ rights, legitimate concerns need to be addressed. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency, reducing delays, enhancing consistency, and maintaining a balance between judicial activism and restraint could strengthen the system and restore public confidence in the judiciary.ConclusionThe recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court concerning the Central Vista project underscores the principle of reasonable restraint in cases where policy matters intersect with the constitutional realm.Recognizing the Government’s prerogative to wield its autonomy in policymaking, regardless of the outcome, while preserving the sanctity of constitutional values, the Court’s intervention remains justifiable primarily to uphold the integrity of these principles.Judicial review, as a pivotal facet of India’s democratic edifice, sustains the equilibrium of powers, shields individual rights, and elevates the Constitution’s supremacy. Striking this intricate equilibrium is imperative for preserving democratic principles and safeguarding the cornerstone of constitutional values within the ever-evolving landscape of the Indian legal framework."

    "headline": "Exploring the Right to Privacy in India from a Legal and Constitutional Perspective",
    "data": " IntroductionThe right to privacy, a cornerstone of individual freedom, lacks a universally accepted legal definition. Legal experts often characterize it as a fundamental human right that every person enjoys simply by virtue of their existence. Privacy transcends reliance on any particular legal instrument or charter and encompasses a multitude of dimensions. This article delves into the legal intricacies of the right to privacy, examining its various facets and historical evolution.The Multifaceted Notion of PrivacyThe Evolution of the Right to Privacy in IndiaThe Indian Constitution’s framers did not explicitly intend for the right to privacy to exist, and it did not initially find a place in Part III of the Constitution, which is concerned with fundamental rights. However, the judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and evolving the concept of privacy in India. The following key milestones chart the evolution of privacy rights in the country:Incorporating Personal Sensitive DataIn the evolving landscape, the scope of privacy has expanded to encompass personal sensitive data, such as medical records and biometrics. Notably, in 1997, the Supreme Court, in the PUCL vs. Union of India case, unequivocally held that individuals have a privacy interest in the content of their telephone communications.This case is a significant legal landmark in India, particularly concerning the right to privacy and the use of surveillance technologies. The case was heard by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.Contemporary Privacy Debates: AadhaarIn recent years, debates about the right to privacy in India have been prominently centered around Aadhaar, a government scheme that assigns a unique ID to residents based on their biometrics and demographic information. While initially challenged on grounds of privacy violations, the Supreme Court’s 2013 order restricted Aadhaar’s usage to public distribution systems and LPG subsidies. However, in 2015, this order was amended to allow the use of Aadhaar in various government schemes while ensuring that no one would be deprived of services due to a lack of Aadhaar.Domestic Laws Pertaining to PrivacyThe Constitution of India does not explicitly guarantee the right to privacy. Nevertheless, through various judgements over the years, Indian courts have interpreted other rights in the Constitution, primarily Article 21 (the right to life and liberty) as giving rise to a limited right to privacy.In 2017, the landmark judgement in the writ petition of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others affirmed that privacy is a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The judgement further clarified that while the right to privacy is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions, as are other fundamental rights.Existing Law on Privacy in IndiaIn the absence of specific legislation exclusively addressing privacy, the right to privacy in India is legally viewed under the Information Technology Act, of 2000. This Act contains provisions that guard individuals against privacy breaches by corporate entities. In 2008, the Act was amended to include Section 43A, which holds companies liable for compromising sensitive personal data and imposes penalties for violations.The government, utilizing its powers under Section 43A, established rules aimed at safeguarding individual privacy by requiring companies to seek permission before accessing personal data and setting liabilities for violations.Implications of the Recognition of PrivacyThe recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right within the Indian Constitution has far-reaching implications. It provides a strong legal basis for the protection of individual freedoms and dignity.Individuals can now directly approach the Supreme Court and High Courts for violations of their fundamental right to privacy, regardless of their nationality. Additionally, privacy’s recognition as an integral part of life and personal liberty elevates it to an essential ingredient of various other fundamental freedoms, including the right to equality, free speech, religion, and other rights crucial for a dignified existence. These rights, however, remain subject to reasonable restrictions based on public health, morality, and order.ConclusionThe integration of the right to privacy into the Indian Constitution represents a watershed moment in the country’s legal history. It solidifies the significance of privacy as a fundamental right and acknowledges its pivotal role in safeguarding individual autonomy and dignity.The Indian Constitution’s resilience and adaptability to evolving notions of privacy in the digital age reflect its enduring commitment to preserving individual freedoms in a complex and ever-changing world.The legal landscape of privacy in India and around the world is continually evolving, reflecting the complex interplay between individual freedoms and the demands of modern society."

    "headline": "Rights and Liabilities of Lessor and Lessee",
    "data": " Lessor and LesseeA lessor is a party who grants the right to use or occupy property to another party in exchange for rent or other consideration. A lessee is a party who acquires the right to use or occupy property from a lessor in exchange for rent or other consideration. The lessor and lessee relationship is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. Both parties have rights and responsibilities, and any breach of the contract may lead to legal consequences.Lease AgreementsA lease is a legally binding arrangement where one party, known as the lessor, grants another party, known as the lessee, the right to use a permanent property for a specific period in exchange for periodic payments.It is defined by Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessor is the property owner providing these rights, while the lessee receives them and pays rent or a premium for such use. To form a legitimate lease, both parties must have the capacity to enter into the agreement, meaning they must share a common interest in the lease, the lessor must have the legal authority to lease the property, and the lessee should be of legal age.Understanding the Role of a LessorThe lessor, as the legal owner of a property or asset, grants the lessee the right to use it for a specified duration while retaining ownership. The lessee makes periodic payments to the lessor based on their agreement, compensating for any losses incurred due to damage or misuse.The lessor must authorize any asset sale and is entitled to any resulting financial gains. While the lessor’s access to the asset is limited during the agreement, they may enter with the lessee’s permission and must notify the lessee of maintenance.In cases of damage or illegal activity by the lessee, the lessor can terminate the lease without notice. At the end of the contract, the property is returned to the lessor, with an option for the lessee to purchase it.Rights of a Lessor Duties of a Lessor Understanding the Role of a LesseeA lessee, also known as a tenant, rents property from a lessor. This arrangement involves specific obligations outlined in a legally binding lease agreement. Failure to comply with the lease terms can result in eviction.Rights of a Lessee Duties of a Lessee ConclusionIn the context of lease agreements, both the lessor and lessee have distinct rights and obligations. Both parties are protected by legal remedies in case of breach, with the lessor having the right to terminate the lease or seek damages, and the lessee entitled to a habitable living space."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’. emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": " IntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer. Landmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Notes on Contract Law- Competency to Contract",
    "data": " IntroductionIn the last article, we discussed the types of contracts and types of offers.In this article, we will learn concepts related to competency to contract, consent, and consideration in greater detail, to gain a nuanced understanding of the law of contracts.Competency to enter into ContractA contract is valid and enforceable in a court of law only when the parties are competent to contract. Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, of 1872 states that a person should be major, of sound mind, and not disqualified by law to have competency to contract.Age of MajorityIn India, age of majority is 18 years according to the Indian Majority Act 1875. Upon completion of 18 years of age, majority is attained.If a person has a guardian appointed by the court, they attain majority at the age of 21.Minors are persons who have not completed eighteen years of age. They are disqualified from contracting because they are incapable of understanding the nature of liabilities arising out of a contract.A contract with minor is void from the beginning, that is, void ab initio.In Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose, the Privy Council ruled that because a contract with minor is void ab initio, a mortgage agreement with a minor will also be void.However, if a minor fulfils their obligations, the other party can be taken to Court as the contract becomes enforceable.To simplify, a minor cannot be taken to court and be compelled to perform their obligation as a contract with them is void from the beginning (void ab initio).Soundness of MindA contracting party should be of sound mind, that is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and liability incurred. Unsoundness can be temporary or permanent.A lunatic person is someone who is of sound mind for a temporary duration. A contract with a lunatic person is valid only when they are of sound mind and capable of understanding the terms of the contract. Otherwise, it is void.A contract with a person who suffers from fits or other temporary unsoundness is also the same. Only if they are sane at the time of entering into the contract, it is valid.The capability to understand the terms of the contract is also a consideration when a party is under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance.Disqualified by LawA person who is not allowed to enter into contracts is disqualified by the law. This can be an alien enemy, that is, a person who is a citizen of a country that India is at war with, or a convict, or an insolvent person, that is, a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been filed.Once parties have been determined to be competent to contract, it is important that both of them have free consent while entering into the contract.Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, contains the definition of consent, which is “when two or more persons agree upon the same thing and in the same sense”.Two parties, A and B entered into a contract for the sale of 125 cotton bales through a ship named Peerless from Bombay in the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus. However, there were two ships named ‘Peerless’.Party A was thinking about one of two ships with the same name, while Party B was thinking of the other ship. The judge ruled that neither party had reached a consensus. As a result, the contract was void.Free ConsentIn Section 14, free consent is defined as consent which is not caused by the following factors-a. Coercion Coercion is committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC to induce the other party to consent to the contract. Such contracts are voidable at the option of the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party has to prove in court that they were coerced to enter into contract.b. Undue InfluenceWhen one party has a relationship of trust or confidence with the other party and they use the relationship to gain an unfair advantage over the other. Such a contract is again voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained with undue influence.c. Fraud Section 17 of the Act, defines fraud as an act committed by a party to induce the other to enter into a contract. This act can include concealment of a fact, a promise without intending to fulfil it or any other act done to deceive the other party. Mere silence is not fraud unless the person has an obligation to speak or the silence is equivalent to speech. A contract due to fraud is void and the offending party should compensate the damages caused.d. Misrepresentation When one party imparts wrong details to induce another to enter into an unfair contract, it is termed as misrepresentation. It is essential that the wrong information should be believed to be correct by the party imparting the details. A contract by misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.e. Mistake Mistakes are of two kinds, of fact and of law. When one or both parties to the contract misunderstand a word that is crucial to understanding its meaning, a mistake of fact results. This mistake may be the result of misunderstanding, ignorance, omission, etc. A mistake is always the result of a careless oversight and these errors may be unilateral or bilateral.For a mistake of law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate defence if the error relates to Indian laws. This implies that neither side may assert that the other is ignorant of the law. However, if the mistake is related to foreign legislations, it is treated as a mistake of fact in India.Contracts arising out of bilateral mistake of fact are void, whereas if only one side makes a mistake, the contract remains valid. Mistake of law for Indian laws does not render the contract void.You can find the last two parts of our notes here and here. "
