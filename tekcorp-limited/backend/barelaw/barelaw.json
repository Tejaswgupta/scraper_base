    "data": "Anticipatory Bail: Insights from Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia vs State of PunjabIn the labyrinth of the Indian legal system, the concept of ‘Anticipatory Bail’ emerges as a beacon of hope for those who fear unjust arrest. The landmark case of Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia & Ors. vs. State of Punjab has become a cornerstone in understanding and applying Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr.P.C.), which governs anticipatory bail in India.Understanding Anticipatory BailAnticipatory bail refers to the judicial process where an individual seeks bail in anticipation of arrest. It’s not explicitly mentioned in Indian legislation, yet it’s a critical aspect of the Cr.P.C. under Section 438. This provision empowers the High Court or Sessions Court to grant bail to a person who apprehends arrest for a non-bailable offence.The Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia Case: A Critical AnalysisThe case under review involved Mr. Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia, then a Minister in the Government of Punjab, who, along with others, faced allegations of corruption. Their anticipatory bail application was initially dismissed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court but was later allowed by the Supreme Court. This judgment laid down significant guidelines for the application of Section 438, ensuring that the courts exercise their discretionary powers judiciously.The Supreme Court GuidelinesThe Supreme Court emphasized that anticipatory bail should not be restricted only to ‘exceptional cases’ but should be used with caution and circumspection. The ruling outlined that the individual must have a ‘reasonable apprehension’ of arrest, and that anticipatory bail should not be denied outright for offences punishable with death or life imprisonment. Additionally, it held that interim bail can be granted without notice to the Public Prosecutor, though notice should follow immediately.Critical PerspectivesThe judgment has been praised for striking a balance between the individual’s right to liberty and the necessity for effective investigation. By setting aside the High Court’s restrictive stance, the Supreme Court has upheld the essence of justice and equality before the law.Implementing Anticipatory Bail: Suggestions for JusticeTo prevent the abuse of anticipatory bail, measures such as seizing passports, freezing bank accounts in severe cases, and mandating the accused’s cooperation with the investigation process have been suggested. These serve as safeguards, ensuring that anticipatory bail acts as a shield against unwarranted arrest, not as a tool for evading the law.ConclusionThe jurisprudence on anticipatory bail, as illuminated by the Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia case, underscores the need for a judicious application tailored to individual cases. It’s a legislative tool designed to uphold personal liberty without compromising the efficacy of the legal process."

    "headline": "Ashoka Kumar Thakur vs Union of India: A Landmark Verdict on OBC Reservations",
    "data": "Introduction: Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of IndiaThe case of Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India is a landmark judgement that delved into the intricacies of social justice and reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBC) in India. This case challenged the Mandal Commission’s classification of 52% of India’s populace as OBC, a figure that was disputed by the National Sample Survey Organisation which estimated it at 42%.Background: In April 2006, the Indian government proposed a constitutional amendment to reserve 27% of seats in higher educational institutions for OBC students, aiming to redress historical social disparities. This decision, however, led to a fierce debate as it reduced the seats for the unreserved category to about 50%. Ashoka Kumar Thakur, in response, filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) challenging the constitutional validity of these amendments.Supreme Court’s Interim Measure: The Supreme Court, while not staying the amendment, decided to delay the implementation of the OBC reservation quota for the academic year 2007-2008, especially in medical and professional institutions. This pause allowed for a deeper examination of the policy’s implications.Judgement: On April 10, 2008, the verdict upheld the 27% OBC reservation in government-funded institutions, introducing the “Creamy Layer” concept to exclude more affluent individuals within the OBC from reservation benefits. This nuanced approach aimed at ensuring that the reservation benefits reach the truly disadvantaged sections within the OBC category.Key Takeaways: The judgement underscored the necessity for a precise identification of OBCs and recommended a more effective commission to handle caste inclusion or exclusion under OBC. It also touched upon various other dimensions such as the necessity of a review mechanism, exclusion criteria for the “Creamy Layer”, and the importance of free and compulsory education for every child.Conclusion: The Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India case has left an indelible mark on the discourse surrounding reservations in India. By affirming the 27% OBC reservation and introducing the “Creamy Layer” concept, it aimed to balance social justice with meritocracy, a debate that continues to shape India’s socio-political landscape."

State of U.P. is a seminal one, shedding light on significant legal and constitutional issues in India. Shakuntala Devi, a sex worker from Lucknow, was arrested and detained under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 (ITPA), which led to a legal discourse on the rights of individuals engaged in sex work​1​.The arrest, based on allegations of prostitution, brought forth a judicial scrutiny of the ITPA, particularly focusing on its constitutionality and its alignment with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution​1​.Legal Issues:Shakuntala Devi’s arrest and detention were scrutinized under the lens of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees every citizen the right to personal liberty. The argument was that Shakuntala Devi’s detention without due process violated this fundamental right. This aspect of the case underscored the necessity for the law enforcement processes to adhere to the constitutional provisions to ensure that the rights of individuals are not infringed upon.The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 (ITPA), was brought under scrutiny for its criminalization of certain aspects of sex work. The legal discourse revolved around whether the Act infringed upon individuals’ right to livelihood and personal freedom. This aspect of the case highlighted the need for laws to be in alignment with the constitutional guarantees, ensuring that they do not unjustly criminalize individuals and deprive them of their fundamental rights.The case raised the question of whether engaging in sex work as a means of livelihood is a fundamental right protected under the Indian Constitution. This brought forward a broader issue of economic rights and the freedom of individuals to choose their occupation. It ignited a discussion on the state’s role in regulating professions and whether such regulation should infringe upon an individual’s choice of occupation, especially when it’s done voluntarily and without coercion.Arguments:\n\nThe arguments from both sides were compelling. Shakuntala Devi’s counsel argued against her detention without due process and defended her right to choose her occupation, while the State of U.P. justified the enforcement of ITPA to curb immoral activities and uphold public morality.

    "data": "Introduction : CBI vs Anupam J. Kulkarni CaseThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) vs Anupam J. Kulkarni case is a prominent legal case that marked a significant turn in Indian jurisprudence. The verdict, delivered on May 8, 1992, by Justice K Jayachandra Reddy and Justice AM Ahmadi of the Supreme Court of India, reverberated across the legal community, setting forth crucial precedents concerning the rights of arrested individuals and the procedural conduct of law enforcement agencies.Historical Backdrop:The early 1990s was a period of evolving legal interpretations in India, with the judiciary increasingly being called upon to safeguard individual rights against potential overreach by law enforcement agencies. Amidst this backdrop, the case of CBI vs Anupam J. Kulkarni emerged as a touchstone, reflecting the balancing act between law enforcement prerogatives and individual rights.Key Legal Issues:Central to this case were several legal issues that bore broader implications for Indian criminal law. Among them were the validity of the sanction for prosecution, the admissibility of evidence, and the defining role and powers of the CBI in combating corruption and forgery. The case posed complex legal questions, testing the robustness of India’s legal framework in ensuring justice while upholding procedural integrity.Judgment and Legal Interpretation:The judgment of May 8, 1992, underscored a pivotal principle: the necessity to produce an arrested person before a Magistrate within 24 hours of arrest. This directive emanated from a constitutional commitment to protect individuals from unlawful detention and ensure a fair procedural process. The court’s articulation provided a clear legal pathway, ensuring that the rights of arrested individuals were not compromised, thus reinforcing the importance of adhering to procedural mandates.Consequences and Broader Implications:The impact of this judgment was far-reaching.

The case became a judicial benchmark, guiding law enforcement agencies in aligning their procedures with constitutional guarantees. Moreover, it sparked discussions within the legal community, prompting a closer examination of existing laws and procedures concerning the rights of the accused.The Abduction Incident:A significant aspect of the case narrative was the incident involving the abduction of four diamond merchants in Bombay. This element brought the role of the CBI into sharp focus, as the inquiry into this incident was assigned to them. It underscored the multifaceted challenges faced by law enforcement agencies, and how the legal framework could either facilitate or impede justice.Conclusion:The CBI vs Anupam J. Kulkarni case remains a seminal case in the annals of Indian criminal law. Its enduring relevance lies in its articulation of crucial legal principles and its impact on shaping law enforcement procedures in alignment with constitutional guarantees.

    "headline": "The Supreme Court’s Scrutiny in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Rustum",
    "data": "State of Madhya Pradesh v. RustumThe case of State of Madhya Pradesh v. Rustum stands as a notable precedent in the Indian legal framework, particularly concerning the correct computation of detention periods as stipulated under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). This section delineates the procedure to be followed when an investigation cannot be concluded within twenty-four hours, providing a legal framework for the detention and bail of the accused during the investigative process. The primary contention in this case was regarding the accurate calculation of the 60/90-day period mentioned within this section, specifically debating if the day of the arrest should be included in the detention period calculation​1​.This legal quandary reached the Supreme Court in the backdrop of a High Court of Madhya Pradesh order dated January 19, 1994, in the Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 3492 of 1993. The High Court had granted what is termed as “compulsive bail” to the accused-respondents, under the aegis of Sections 167(2) of the CrPC. This order was predicated on the argument that 90 days from the commencement of the authorized detention had lapsed, and the challan (a legal invoice or citation) was not filed within this stipulated timeframe, thereby entitling the accused-respondents to bail​2​​3​.Further complexities arose with a subsequent bail application, marking it as the second such application concerning the accused in this case. On the same date, January 19, 1994, bail was granted to two accused-applicants, namely Rustam s/o Chhotu and Dinesh s/o Rustam. However, a different outcome was reached for another applicant whose bail plea was dismissed by the honorable court​4​.The Supreme Court’s adjudication in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Rustum not only clarified the method of computing the detention period but also underscored the legal intricacies surrounding the rights of accused individuals during the pre-trial phase. Through this case, the Supreme Court provided a clearer lens through which the provisions of Section 167 of the CrPC could be interpreted and applied, thereby impacting the jurisprudence concerning detention and bail in India.This case underscores the dynamic interplay between procedural law and the rights of accused individuals, elucidating the legal thresholds and conditions under which bail can be granted, especially in instances where the investigative process extends beyond the stipulated time frames. Through its judgment, the Supreme Court aimed to strike a balance between the rights of the accused and the procedural requisites of the criminal justice system, thereby contributing to a more nuanced understanding of detention and bail procedures within the Indian legal landscape."

Singhara Singh stands out as a beacon in this context, offering profound insights into Section 164 of the Indian Penal Code. This article delves into the depths of this case, unraveling its significance and the broader implications for the role of magistrates.Historical Context:To appreciate the nuances of the case, it’s essential to understand the backdrop against which it was set. Section 164 of the Indian Penal Code pertains to the recording of confessions and statements by a magistrate. While the section meticulously outlines the procedure and conditions for recording confessions, it leaves certain aspects open to interpretation.The Crux of the Matter:The State of UP v. Singhara Singh centered on one pivotal question: Can a magistrate provide oral evidence of a confession made to him? This question, seemingly straightforward, has profound implications for the administration of justice.The Judgment:The court’s verdict was unambiguous. It held that Section 164, by necessary implication, prohibits the magistrate from giving oral evidence of the confession made to him. This ruling was grounded in several key considerations:Broader Implications:The State of UP v. Singhara Singh is not just a case in isolation. Its ramifications reverberate throughout the legal system:Standardizing Judicial Procedures: The judgment serves as a benchmark, standardizing procedures across courts, ensuring uniformity in the treatment of confessions.Enhancing Credibility: By emphasizing written records, the judgment enhances the credibility of the judicial process, ensuring that decisions are based on tangible evidence rather than potentially fallible oral testimonies.Strengthening the Pillars of Justice: The judgment fortifies the pillars of justice – fairness, impartiality, and transparency. By delineating the boundaries of magistrates’ roles, it ensures that justice is not only done but also seen to be done.Conclusion:The State of UP v. Singhara Singh serves as a testament to the evolving nature of Indian jurisprudence. By addressing a seemingly simple question, the judgment has illuminated the path for countless subsequent cases, ensuring that the scales of justice remain balanced. For legal scholars, practitioners, and enthusiasts, understanding the intricacies of such landmark cases is not just an academic exercise but a journey into the heart of the Indian legal system."

But if one reads section 209 and 331 of the U. P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms-Act (I of 1951) together one finds that a suit like the instant one has to be filed before a special court created under the Act within a period of limitation specially prescribed under the Rules made under the Act and the jurisdiction of the ordinary Civil Court is absolutely barred.2SUB-SECTION (2) — APPLICATION OF THE PROVISION TO DELHI HIGH COURT’S ORIGINAL JURISDICTION.Under the Delhi High Court Act, 1966, a suit valuing more than fifty thousand rupees is triable by the High Court in its original side. As such the Delhi High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction in respect of Union Territory of Delhi is competent to try such suit, taking it as a suit of civil nature.3IMPORTANCE OF THE SECTION — APPLICATION OF THE CODE TO REVENUE COURTS — PROVISIONS OF SECTION 104 DO NOT SEEK, LIMIT OR AFFECT THE PROVISIONS OF LETTERS PATENT.The importance of this section is that wherever the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure are sought to be excluded by any special enactment which may be silent on the point, the State Government can by notification apply the provisions of Revenue Courts. All other civil courts would normally be governed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure in the matter of procedure. Section 4(1) of the Code which is a saving provision clearly provides that in the absence of any specific provision to the contrary the provisions of the Code do not limit or affect any special or local law. Thus the test contained in Section 4 is not applicable in the instant case because even if the Letters Patent of the High Court be deemed to be special law as contemplated by Section 4 the provisions of Section 104 do not seek to limit or affect the provisions of the Letters Patent.4APPLICATION OF THE CODE TO REVENUE COURTS — JURISDICTION OF ORDINARY CIVIL COURT WHEN BARRED.The Supreme Court had laid down:No doubt if the suit is one properly entertainable by the Civil Court the period of limitation must be governed by the provisions of the Limitation Act and no other. But if one reads section 209 and 331 of the U. P.

D………………………………………………………….. PlaintiffversusC. F……………………………………………………….. DefendantTo,The Hon’ble Chief Justice and his companion Judge of the High Court of Delhi.1. That the appellant had filed a petition under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act in the original side of this Court bearing suit No………………… of 1981.2. That in the said suit the Appellant had moved Misc. Application No………………… under section 41, read with Second Schedule of the Arbitration Act, asking for issue of a temporary injunction restraining the appellant from encashing the bank guarantee.3. That the application was decided by Hon’ble……………….. J. of this Court, who held that it was well settled that the performance guarantee, even though having its genesis in the primary contract between the parties, is nevertheless autonomous and independent contract;That a Bank which gives a performance guarantee must honour the guarantee according to its terms and that it is not concerned in the least with the relations between the supplier and the customer, nor with- questions of performing the obligations by the parties. The guarantee was bound to be absolute and the application was accordingly dismissed.4. That against the order of dismissal, the appellant filed the present Letters Patent Appeal, which has been admitted by this Hon’ble Court on……………….. 1984, and ad interim injunction has been granted to the appellant.5. That it is respectfully submitted that the matter is referable to Arbitration Act, and law of arbitration, being a special law, in force in the Country is attracted in the matter, and that law will govern the future course of the action.6. That the right vis a vis filing of an appeal in the context of the law which is attracted, would crystallise on the date on which the matter was originally instituted and a later amendment may not adversely affect the right of the respondent, and as such section 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure is attracted and the orders of interim injunction as well as admitting the appeal are beyond the jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure not being applicable to matter.7. That it is expedient that the order of admitting the appeal as well as of issue of temporary injunction may be recalled, and the appeal may be dismissed as not maintainable.PRAYERIt is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to recall the orders admitting the appeal and issue of temporary injunction dated……………….. may be recalled and the appeal may be dismissed as being without jurisdiction.PlaintiffThroughAdvocateVERIFICATIONI, abovenamed plaintiff, do hereby verify that the contents of paras ……………….. to……………….. of the plaint are true to my personal knowledge and those of paras……………….. and……………….. thereof are based on legal advice which I believe to be true.Verified on this…………….. day of……………….. 19……………….. at………………..PlaintiffCASE LAWSection 4LIMITATIONS OF THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.This section in terms lays down that when anything in the Civil Procedure Code is in conflict with anything in the special or local law or with any special jurisdiction or power conferred or any special forum or procedure prescribed by or under any other law, the Code will not, in the absence of specific provision to the contrary, prevail so as to override such inconsistent provision.1If any law prescribes that a certain person must be impleaded as a defendant, even though no relief is sought against him, the failure to implead him will be fatal to the suit, notwithstanding the provision of Order 1, Rule 9 of the Code.2SUPREME COURT RULES ARE SPECIAL LAWS.Rules framed by the Supreme Court with reference to appeal to it are a special law within the meaning of this section and take precedence over Section 114 or O. 47 of the Code.3DECLARATORY RELIEF — AVAILABILITY IN CIVIL COURT.A declaratory suit is maintainable by Civil Court and such a relief is not provided for under the Companies Act.

That on account of the refusal by the Court below to admit the said documents in evidence as the applicant has not been able to substantiate his defence in the Court below and thus lost the case.PRAYERIt is therefore most respectfully prayed that the documents referred to in para 1 above may be taken on record as an additional evidence and such order as this Court may think fit may be made in that respect.It is prayed accordingly.ApplicantThrough AdvocatePlace:………………..Dated:………………..CASE LAWOrder 41, Rule 27APPLICATION OF THE RULE—ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE—WHEN TO BE ADMITTED.The discretion to receive and admit additional evidence is not an arbitrary one, but is a judicial one circumscribed by the limitation specified in O. 41, Rule 27, Civil P. C. If the additional evidence was allowed to be adduced contrary to the principles governing the reception of such evidence, it would be a case of improper exercise of discretion, and the additional evidence so brought on the record will haveto he ignored and the case decided as it was non-existent. Under O. 41, Rule 27, it is the appellate court that must require the evidence to enable it to pronounce judgment. As laid down by the Privy Council in the well-known case1.“The legitimate occasion for the application of the present rule is, when on examining the evidence, as it stands, some inherent lacuna or defect becomes apparent, not where a discovery is made, outside the court, of fresh evidence and application is made to import it. ” And they reiterated this view in stronger terms even in the later case2. The true test, therefore, is whether the appellate court is able to pronounce judgment on the materials before it without taking into consideration the additional evidence sought to be adduced3.ADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE—WHEN CAN BE REFUSED? (MANY YEARS AFTER FILING SUIT).Before the High Court, Pramod Kumari filed an application for reception of additional evidence. The principal additional evidence sought to be adduced was an alleged letter said to have been written by late Pearey Lal Singh to the bank nominating Pramod Kumari as the person entitled to the amount in deposit with the bank. The letter itself was not filed along with the application but a request was made to summon the letter from the bank. The High Court rejected the application. The application to the High Court was made very many years after the suit had been filed, and also quite some years after the appeal had been filed before the High Court, and we do not think that we will be justified in interfering with the discretion exercised by the High Court in refusing to receive additional evidence at that stage. The appeal is therefore dismissed but in the circumstances with no order as to costs4.POWER OF HIGH COURT UNDER SECTION 115 CPCOrder 41, Rule 27, Section 15The High Court in exercise of its power under Section 115, CPC, could not interfere with an order of appellate Court rejecting permission to adduce additional evidence particularly when the whole appeal is not before the High Court.5ADDITIONAL EVIDENCEOrder 41, Rule 27Section 107, CPC enables an appellate Court to take additional evidence or to require such other evidence to be taken subject to such conditions and limitations as are prescribed under Order XII, Rule 27, CPC.51.

F………………………………………………………. DefendantThe applicant most respectfully submits as under: —1. That the present suit has been filed by the applicant for recovery of possession of the property situate at……………….. against the defendants.2. That the aforesaid is commercial property and when it is given on rent, is going to fetch more than Rs………………… per year.3. That the defendants have no property of their own within the jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court.4. That in the circumstances it is therefore expedient in the ends of justice that a receiver be appointed by the Court to take possession of the suit property and to realise the rent and deposit the same in this Hon’ble Court.PRAYERIt is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that a Receiver may be appointed by this Hon’ble Court to take possession of the suit property.It is prayed accordingly.ApplicantThrough AdvocatePlace: …………………Dated: …………………CASE LAWOrder 40 Rule 1APPOINTMENT OF RESPONDENT AS RECEIVER—PETITIONER’S COUNTER CLAIM REJECTED—PROPRIETY OF.The receiver was appointed for managing Colliery pit in dispute. He was authorised to appoint an agent for working the pit in question. One or the other of the parties was to be appointed as the agent undisputably. The respondent acceptedthe offer made by the receiver. Thereafter the petitioner also expressed his willingness to accept the offer but by way of a counter offer raising the minimum guarantee. After consulting the Advocate General of West Bengal, the Receiver held that there was a concluded contract between him and the respondent, and he appointed the respondent as his agent to work pit I.That from the facts set out, it is absolutely clear that the receiver had acted in the most proper manner. There is no basis for the allegation made by the petitioner that he had been coerced to appoint the respondent as his agent. The fact that at one stage the respondent had filed an application to the Supreme Court to remove the receiver can in no manner be said to have influenced the decision of the receiver to appoint the respondent as his agent. There were no grounds to think that the receiver had acted either improperly or under coercion1.APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER — ACT DONE IS SUBJECT TO DIRECTIONS AND ORDERS OF COURT.Any act of the Receiver done on behalf of the court pendente. lite and anyone who gets possession through such an act could only do so subject to the directions and Orders of the Court. The tenancy created in favour of “T” by the Receiver is in violation and contrary to the injunction order and such an act is subject to the direction and order of the Court appointing the Receiver. Therefore, the tenancy created in favour of “T” was in breach of the order of the Court and consequently “T” cannot claim any protection under the provisions of the Act and they are liable to be evicted2.APPLICATION FOR APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER—DEFAULT IN PAYMENT OF INSTALMENT TO FINANCIAL CORPORATION-MILL OWNER WILLING TO DEPOSIT INSTALMENT — ORDER SET ASIDE.An affidavit has been filed by the appellant that the amount of Corporation has been paid. The only amount that remains due is penal interest but its waiver is under consideration of the corporation.In the circumstances there is no merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the respondent that the order of the High Court directing handing over of the mill to receiver should not be interfered. The running of the Mill, in the circumstances of this case by the family member, subject to the decision of the suit, shall be just and proper. Moreover the High Court had vacated its order because of the default in payment of instalment to the Corporation. Since that has been complied with we do not think it would be in interest of justice to maintain the order of High Court3.JOINT FAMILY PROPERTY—KARTA OF HUF DISPOSING OF SOME PROPERTY IN CONTRAVENTION OF COURT ORDER-APPLICATION FOR APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER—SUPREME COURT APPOINTING ADMINISTRATOR WITH POWERS AND DUTIES OF RECEIVER.Allowing the appeal it was held that it was just and convenient in order to effectively prevent any of the suit properties being dissipated or disposed of and in order to preserve the same that the suit properties should be placed under the management and control of a person other than Karta. The court appointed Administrator in respect of the properties having the same powers and duties of Receiver4.Order 40 Rule 1APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER ON DISSOLUTION OF FIRMA receiver is to be appointed as a matter of course when a partnership is dissolved under orders of Court or if a partnership is already dissolved any of the parties come to Court for relief due to him as an ex-partner5.WHEN RECEIVER CAN BE APPOINTEDThe Court should appoint a receiver in a mortgage suit as in a suit of any other nature when it is just and convenient6.STAGES FOR APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER.The Court has power to appoint a receiver whenever it appears to be just and convenient whether before or after the decree. The jurisdiction to appoint a receiver is not restricted by any words contained in the decree7.THIRD PARTY RECEIVER — WHEN MAY BE APPOINTED — CONSIDERATIONS FOR.In a case which arises under this Rule, the primary thing which has to be looked into by a court before the wishes of the parties are acceded to is to see how best the suit properties could be preserved without being wasted. The responsibility in courts becomes all the more greater if there is a race as between the two competing parties to possess the suit properties. It is imperative for the courts to see that the suit properties over which such conflicting claims are projected, are not only preserved but are kept without being wasted or without any prejudice, being caused to any one of the parties to the litigation by any overt or covert act on the part of any party to it. It is only to create a harmony and not to ferment disharmony that the intendment of this Rule should be perpetrated8.WHEN APPOINTMENT OF THIRD PARTY AS RECEIVER NOT PROPER.Where in a partition suit, the appellant is admittedly in possession of a house on an alleged plot of land and is living there with his family members, he had inducted tenants in the other houses and rooms on that plot and till late was realising rent from the said tenants and repairing those houses regularly, the Court below was not justified in appointing a third party as receiver of that plot of land during the pendency of the suit9.REMAND TO TRIAL COURT FOR APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVERAs regards the appointment of receiver, where no orders were passed by the Trial Court and as such no appeal was competent, the lower appellate Court was of opinion that the suit shall not have been stayed under section 3 of the Arbitration Act, then the case should have been sent back to trial court for deciding the application for appointment of receiver.10APPOINTING OF RECEIVER (ORDER 40 RULE 1)The power to appoint a Receiver suo motu, cannot be exercised by the High Court particularly when none of the parties has asked for it.11REVIEW — SCOPEOrder 40 Rule 1The power of review can be exercised for correction of a mistake and not to substitute a view. Such powers can be exercised within the limits of the statute dealing with the exercise of power. The review cannot be treated as an appeal in disguise.12POWER TO APPOINT RECEIVERThe power to appoint a Receiver suo motu cannot be exercised in the manner in which it was exercised by the High Court.13“JUDGMENT” — WHAT CONSTITUTES(Section 2(9)/Order 40 Rule 4(2)Judgment should be a self-contained document from which it should appear as to what were the facts of the case and what was the controversy which was tried to be settled by the court and in what manner.141.

The trial court will decide the matter in accordance with law in the light of its own assessment1.PROVISO—WHEN ORDER OF INJUNCTION IS ILLEGALWhere temporary injunction is granted without notice to opposite party but reasons for court’s opinion that delay would defeat the object of injunction if it were not given, the order of injunction is illegal2.EX PARTE INJUNCTION TO PLAINTIFF PARTNERS RESTRAINING DEFENDANT PARTNERS WHEN CAN BE GRANTED.While it is true that being partners the appellant’s right to participate in the business of the plaintiff and to have access to the place of business and the account books cannot be denied, it is equally true that they cannot be permitted to carry hostile activities which may adversely affect the partnership business itself and may bring it to a stand still. The trial court’s step to prevent the appellants from interfering with the day to day management and working of the partnership, cannot be said that the formation of opinion by trial court to proceed in terms of Rule 3 and its proviso to pass an ex parte temporary injunction violates any of those provisions and calls for any interference3.1.

DefendantsAPPLICATION UNDER ORDER 39 RULES 1 AND 2 READ WITH SECTION 151 CPC ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF FOR GRANT OF AD-INTERIM EX-PARTE INJUNCTIONRespectfully Showeth:1. That the plaintiff has filed the accompanying suit for permanent injunction against the defendants which is pending disposal before this Hon’ble Court.,2. That the plaintiff craves leave of this Hon’ble Court and prays that the contents of the accompanying plaint/suit may kindly be read as part and parcel of this application as those are not being repeated herein for the sake of brevity.3. That the defendants particularly Nos. 1 and 2 are influential people who believe in taking the law in their own hands and also believe on using muscle powers.4. That the defendants Nos. 2 and 3 are bent upon grabbing the room and kitchen built by plaintiff with his own hard earned money and are threatening to forcibly evict the plaintiff and his family through collusion with goondas and of official machinery functioning.5. That in case the defendants succeed in achieving their illegal designs of forcibly evicting the plaintiff then the plaintiff will suffer an irreparable loss and injury which cannot be compensated in terms of money.6. That the plaintiff has a good prima facie case in his favour and against the defendant and is likely to succeed therein.7. That the balance of convenience also lies in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant.It is therefore respectfully prayed that during the pendency of the accompanying suit the defendants Nos. 1 to 3, their agents, servants, relatives etc. may kindly be restrained from selling, parting with, alienating, creating third party interest, interferring with the peaceful possession, occupation, enjoyment and use of the demised premises in and adjacent to House No………………… by passing an ad-interim injunction in favour of the plaintiff.PlaintiffThrough AdvocatePlace:………………..Dated:………………..AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATIONIN THE COURT OF………………..Suit No………………… of 200In the Matter of: –AB…………………………………………………………..

That I am the plaintiff in the above noted case and am well versed with the facts of the case, and as such, am competent to depose to the same.2. That the accompanying application under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2 read with section 151 CPC has been drafted under my instructions. The contents stated therein are true and correct to my knowledge, and the same may be read as part and parcel of this affidavit.DeponentVERIFICATIONVerified at……………….. on this……………….. day of……………….. that the contents of the above affidavit are true and correct to my knowledge, no part of it is false and nothing material has been concealed therefrom.Deponent.case lawWHEN RELIEF TO BE GRANTED.The relief should be awarded only in clear cases, reasonably free from doubt, and, when necessary, to prevent great and irreparable injury1.BURDEN OF PROOFBurden of proof rests upon the complainant to establish the material allegations entitling him to relief2.POWER TO BE EXERCISED WITH EXTREME CAUTION.To be applied in very clear cases — Guidelines for exercise of discretionary powers3.CIRCUMSTANCES NOT COVERED BY ORDER 39 CPC — INHERENT JURISDICTION.There being no such expression in Section 94 which expressly prohibits the issue of a temporary injunction in circumstances not covered by Order 39 or by any rules made under the Code, the Courts have inherent jurisdiction to issue temporary injunction in circumstances which are not covered by the provisions of Order 39, if the Court is of opinion that the interests of justice require the issue of such interim injunction4.INJUNCTION WHEN ONLY AN INTERIM ORDER.The matter ought to have been concluded by a final hearing as to whether temporary injunction will continue, if so on what terms until the disposal of the suit5.OBSERVATIONS MADE IN INTERLOCUTORY PROCEEDINGS — FINAL ORDER.The trial court in deciding the suit itself will not allow its mind to be affected in any manner by the observations which are made in the interlocutory proceedings. It should be clearly understood that at the final stage the suit is to be decided on the evidence which is led by the parties and any observations made during the proceedings in respect of the prayer for a temporary injunction whether made in the Courts below or by the High Court have no relevance whatsoever in passing the final verdict after the trial of the suit6.REJOINDER TO THE REPLY BY THE DEFENDANT AGAINST TEMPORARY INJUNCTION.The contingency of filing a rejoinder does not arise in every case, because it would arise only in such cases where some new plea or fact is introduced by the defendant in reply7.INTERLOCUTORY ORDER IN THE COURSE OF A PROCEEDING WHEN WILL LAPSE.With the final decision of the suit itself, unless of course the suit is one for permanent injunction and the interim injunction is made permanent as part of the decreed order by the Court8.FINDING ARRIVED AT IN DEALING WITH TEMPORARY INJUNCTION.The findings arrived at in dealing with applications for temporary injunction pending disposal of the suit, even if they relate to any material question involved in the suit cannot take the place of findings in the final decision of the suit9.PRINCIPLES THAT GOVERN GRANT OR REFUSAL OF AN INTERIM INJUNCTION.They depend upon a variety of circumstances. It is impossible to lay down, any rigid general rule on the subject by which the discretion of the Court ought in all cases be regulated.It is true, that at the interlocutory stage, the court should not embark upon a detailed investigation on the relative merits of the contentions of the parties and it is enough if the plaintiff raises questions of a substantial character calling for decision after an examination of the facts and the law arising in the case.The court should avoid expressing any opinion on the merits which would partake the character of a decision of the main issues in the case10.JURISDICTION OF THE COURT TO ENTERTAIN THE SUIT.It is incumbent upon the Court to determine that question as preliminary issue before making the order of injunction absolute11.REJECTION OF PLAINT — TEMPORARY INJUNCTION ISSUED BYTRIAL COURT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY STAND REVIVED.Orders granting temporary injunction do not aid and supplement the ultimate decision of the suits12.CAUTION TO BE EXERCISED(a) Fair prima facie case;(b) Actual or threatened violation of the right;(c) Productive or irreparable or atleast serious injury.(d) Conduct;(e) Acquiescence or delay;(f) Greater convenience and(g) No efficacious relief.THE PHRASES “PRIMA FACIE CASE”, “BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE” AND “IRREPARABLE LOSS”.Are not rhetoric phrases for incantation, but words of width and elasticity, to meet myriad situations, presented by mans ingenuity in given facts and circumstances, but always is hedged with sound exercise of judicial discretion to meet the ends of justice. It is very neigh impossible to find from facts prima facie case and balance of convenience. The respondent can be adequately compensated on their success13.INGREDIENT TO BE ESTABLISHED TO OBTAIN AN INTERLOCUTORY INJUNCTION.(i) In the event of withholding the relief of temporary injunction he will suffer an irreparable injury;(ii) In the event of his success in the suit in establishing his alleged legal right encroachment whereof is “complained against, he will not have the proper remedy in being awarded adequate damages.(iii) The plaintiff must show a clear necessity for affording immediate protection to his legal right, if any and(iv) Lastly the Court has to take into consideration the comparative mischief or inconvenience to the parties14.TEMPORARY INJUNCTION UNDER SECTION 151 HAVING SAME IMPORT AS THAT OF THE ORDER PASSED UNDER ORDER 39 RULES 1 AND 2.The appeal before the appellate court against such interim order was maintainable15.APPELLATE COURT HAS ALL THE POWERS WHICH ARE VESTED IN THE TRIAL COURT.But when the Court is considering the legality of the order of grant or refusal of temporary injunction in writ jurisdiction unless there is a fundamental wrong committed by the court below, it is not possible for the High Court to interfere with the orders of the court below which do not suffer from any error of law or infirmity.EX PARTE AD INTERIM INJUNCTION — COURT DECLINING TO PASS ORDER — ORDER NOT APPEALABLE.Where court is not satisfied that it should consider an application for temporary injunction under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 before notice to the Opposite party, it does not pass an order under these provisions, rather postpones the consideration of such application to a later date after notice to the opposite party and against such order no appeal lies16.JURISDICTION OF APPELLATE COURT — INJUNCTION PETITION CANNOT BE DECIDED ON MERITS.The powers is only to grant interim relief either in the nature of granting ad interim injunction or modify such an order for the purpose of preventing a possible injury or to preserve the subject matter of the suit for the time being. To enable the appellate court to consider the petition for injunction on merits for the first time will be virtually conferring jurisdiction on the appellate court which it otherwise does not have17.CONCURRENT FINDING ON THE QUESTION OF BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE.Courts having arrived at such conclusion did not commit any error of law or approach in that conclusion. No interference under revisional jurisdiction18.GRANT OR REFUSAL OF TEMPORARY INJUNCTION RESTS ON SOUND EXERCISE OF DISCRETION.It cannot be lightly interfered with unless it is shown that such exercise of discretion is unreasonable or capricious19.COURT TO SCRUTINISE WHETHER THE APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTION IS UNDER ORDER 39 OR SECTION 151 OF THE CODE.Where the court proceeded to discuss the requirements of prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable injury, inference will be justified that the Court acted under order 39 rather than under section 151 CPC. On the other hand, if the court observed that no injunction was justified under order 39 rules 1 and 2 but for the ends of justice, under the circumstances of the case, an order was passed then it would be reasonable to hold that the impugned order was passed under section 151 of the Code. This may be taken only as a guideline and not as a cut and dried formula20.CONSIDERATIONS WHETHER AN INJUNCTION SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT ISSUE THREE REQUIREMENTS.Whether an order of injunction should not issue on the facts of the case, the Court must also consider apart from prima facie case, the question of irreparable or serious injury and balance of convenience.(a) Prima facie case21.(b) Balance of convenience22.(c) Irreparable loss and injury23Order 39 Rules 1 & 2BANK GUARANTEE — CONTRACT NOT VITIATED BY ANY FRAUD — NO IRRETRIEVABLE INJURY — INJUNCTION NOT TO BE GRANTED.In law relating to bank guarantees, a party seeking injunction from encashing of bank guarantee by the suppliers has to show prima facie case of established fraud and an irretrievable injury. Irretrievable injury is of the nature as noticed in the case of Itek Corporation (566 Federal Supplement 1210), that is plaintiff has no adequate remedy in law and the allegations of irreparable harm are not speculative but genuine and immediate, the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if the requested relief is not granted.Here there is no such problem. Once the plaintiff is able to establish fraud against the suppliers or suppliers-cum-lenders and obtains any decree for damages or diminution in price, there is no problem for affecting recoveries in a friendly country where the bankers and the suppliers are located. Nothing has been pointed out to show that the decree passed by the Indian Courts could not be executable in Sweden24.PHRASES “PRIMA FACIE CASE”, “BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE” AND “IRREPARABLE LOSS”.The phrases “Prima Facie Case” “balance of convenience” and “irreparable loss” are not rhetoric phrases for incantation but words of width and elasticity, to meet myriad situations presented by man’s ingenuity in given facts and circumstances, but always is hedged with sound exercise of judicial discretion to meet the ends of justice25.Order 39 Rule 24.WHETHER AGENT OF DEFENDANT CAN BE PROCEEDED AGAINST?— (YES).The expression “person” occurring in sub-rule (1) of the old provision of Rule 2, corresponding to Rule 2A of the Amended Code has been employed merely compendiously to designate every one in a group, defendant, his agent, servants and workmen and not for excluding any defendant against whom the order of injunction has primarily been pressed26.Order 39 Rules 1 and 2The injunction restraining transfer for property during pendency of the suit can be granted27.It is now a settled position in law that an appeal lies against the order granting as well as refusing an injunction. There was a difference of opinion on this issue but now by catena of case law the position is settled that an appeal would lie not only against an order granting injunction but also against an order refusing the same as even that order could be described as an order passed under Order XXXIX, Rule 1 or 2 as the case may be.Where an application for ex-parte injunction is made and the court refused to grant such an injunction and instead issues notice of the application to the opposite party. The order of refusal would be an order under Rule 1 or Rule 2 as the case may be and not under Rule 3 and hence it would be appealable under Order XLIII Rule l(r)28.BREACH OF INJUNCTION ORDEROrder 39, Rule 2(A)(1)Where no order of injunction was passed against persons not impleaded in the suit they cannot be held guilty for breach of any order pased in such proceedings.29ORDER IN CONTEMPT APPLICATION PASSED BY TRIAL COURT CANNOT BE KEPT IN ABEYANCE BY HIGH COURT WITHOUT DECIDING APPEAL ON MERITS.Order 39, Rule 2AOrder passed by trial Court in contempt application under Order 39 Rule 2A CPC cannot be kept in abeyance by High Court in appeal without deciding appeal on merits.30EX-PARTE INTERIM INJUNCTIONOrder 39 Rule 3If a Court which passed the order granting interim ex-parte injunction did not record reasons thereof or did not require the applicant to perform the duties enumerated in clauses (a) and (b) of Rule 3 of Order 39, such an order can be deemed to contain such requirements at least by implication even if they are not stated in so many words.31EX-PARTE INTERIM INJUNCTIONOrder 39 Rule 3-ARule 3-A does not say that the period of the injunction order should be restricted by the Court to thirty days at the first instance, but the Court should pass final order on it within thirty days from the day on which the injunction was granted. Hence, the order does not ipso facto become illegal merely because it was not restricted to a period of thirty days or less.321. A. I. R. 1965 Mys. 310.2. A. I. R. 1965 Mys. 310.3. A. I.

The question whether the defence raises a triable issue or not has to be ascertained by the Court from the pleadings before it and the affidavits of parties.(b) If the Court is satisfied that the facts disclosed by the defendant do not indicate that he has a substantial defence to raise or that the defence intended to put by the defendant is frivolous or vexatious it may refuse leave to defend altogether.(c) In cases where the Court entertains a genuine doubt on the question as to whether the defence is genuine or sham or whether it raises a triable issue or not, the Court may impose conditions in granting leave to defend. The Court would be justified in coming to the conclusion that the issue is not a triable issue when the defence is plausible but is improbable and in such cases it can put the defendant on terms while granting leave to defend.(d) In cases where the defendant admits that a part of the amount claimed by the plaintiff is due from him the Court shall not grant leave to defend the suit unless the amount so admitted to be due is deposited by the defendant in Court.(e) The Court while granting leave to defend must take care to see that the object of the Rule to assist the expeditious disposal of criminal cases to which the order applies is not defeated.(f) The Court should further take care to see that real and genuine triable issues are not shot out by unduly severe orders as to deposit1.1. Fateh Lal v. Sunder Lal, A. I. R. 1980 Raj. 220: 1980 W. L. N. 188.The following principles, in respect of the grant of leave to defendant, on the basis of present provision of O. 37 of the Code, emerge:(1) It is discretionary with the Court either to refuse or to grant leave to defend unconditionally or upon such terms as may appear to the Court to be just. But the aforesaid exercise of the discretion should be judicial and not arbitrary and whimsical.(2) In case the defence intended to be put up if frivolous or vexatious, leave to defend must be refused.(3) An unconditional leave to defend must be given if the facts disclosed by the defendant indicate that he has a substantial defence to raise, which means that defence so raised has good chance of success or has good potentiality to dislodge the plaintiff or which is bona fide and honest one and raises such question of law or of facts which require through judicial scrutiny.(4) If the facts set up by the defendant do not disclose- a substantial defence, leave should normally be refused or else on account of mercy as provided for in the Supreme Court Judgment (A. I. R. 1977 S. C. 577) or due to a desire to exclude even remote chance of injustice to the defendant, leave to defend may be granted subject to the condition of deposit of amount claimed by the plaintiff or furnishing a security in respect of that amount or deposit of part of that amount and furnishing security for the payment of balance.(5) Where a part of the amount claimed by the plaintiff is admitted by the defendant to be due from him, leave to defend the suit shall not be granted unless the amount so admitted to be due is deposited by the defendant in Court2.EX-PARTE DECREE WITHOUT FOLLOWING PROCEDURE NOT VALID.On the scheme of Rule 3 fulfilment of the two obligations by the defendant are intended to facilitate the plaintiff in applying for a summary judgment under sub-rule (4) but exercise of such right by the plaintiff is not entirely dependant thereon. Hence on the context and on the scheme of Rule 3 it cannot be said that the Legislature intended fulfilment of those obligations by the defendant to be a part of his act of appearance. Accordingly when a decree was passed without following sub-rules (4), (5) and (6) of Rule 3, it was held to be not valid3.2. Har Prasad & Co. Ltd. v. Allahabad Bank, A. I. R. 1983 Delhi 280 (283).3. Subir Kumar v. Mh. Habibur Riswas, A. I. R. 1980 Cal. 364.WHEN APPEARANCE BY DEFENDANT IS SUFFICIENTThere is no particular form prescribed for entering appearance under Order 37, Rule 3. Where in a suit to which Order 37 applies the defendant filed an application purporting to be under Section 21 of the Code challenging the jurisdiction of the Court, but made no assertion in the application that to avoid ex-parte decree he is putting his appearance, the requirement of Order 37, Rule 3, as regarding entering of appearance by the defendant was complied with4.WHEN LEAVE TO DEFEND SHOULD BE GRANTED — ILLUSTRATION.Where the cheque was dishonoured as the owner did not have sufficient funds in the bank and that is why the endorsement on the memo by the Bank was “Referred to drawer”. Nevertheless, the defence being put forth that the amount of the cheque was on account and the writing of July 15, 1978 proved that fact, may seem to illusory but the defendant in the circumstances ought to be enabled to prove it. Accordingly leave was granted to the defendant to appear and defend the suit on condition of furnishing a bank guarantee for Rs. 3000/- in the trial court within a month5.NON-MAINTAINABILITY OF APPLICATION FOR CONDONATION OF DELAY WITHOUT ENTERING APPEARANCE.Under Order 37, Rule 3 (7) if sufficient cause is shown for non-appearance or in applying for leave to defend the suit, the delay may be excused, but until the defendant enters appearance the court obviously cannot excuse any delay and no time can be given to them for appearance6.RECORDING REASONS FOR ORDER: NECESSITY.While making an order under this Rule, refusing leave to defend the suit or granting the leave subject to conditions the trial court should record the reasons for making the said order7.Order 37, Rule 2, Institution of Summary SuitsHIGH COURT’S EXPRESSING OPINION ON A QUESTION OF FACT EVEN BEFORE EVIDENCE WAS LED BY PARTIES IN THE SUIT — IMPROPRIETY OF — DEFENCE PREJUDICED THEREBY.O. 37 R. 2 and 3, S. 115The Supreme Court has repeatedly laid down the well established principles4. Haryana Brewaries Ltd. v. Aluminium Manufacturing Co. Ltd., A. I. R. 1980 Delhi 311.5. Inderjit Sahdeo v. Ram Singh, A. I. R. 1980 Delhi 97: 1980 Rajdhani L. R. 410.6. Haryana Brewaries Ltd. v. Aluminium Manufacturing Co. Ltd., A. I. R. 1980 Delhi 311.7. Fateh Lal v. Sunder Lal, A. I. R. 1980 Raj. 220: 1980 W. L. N. 188.which govern jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 115 C. P. C. These principles were ignored by the High Court in interfering with the discretionary order after a very detailed discussion of the facts of the case, differing on a pure question, of fact — whether the defences could be honest and bonafide. Any decision on such a question even before evidence has been led by the two sides, is generally hazardous. It is not fair to pronounce a categorical opinion on such a matter before the evidence of the parties is taken so that its effects could be examined. In the instant case, the defendant had denied, inter alia, liability to pay anything to the plaintiff for an alleged supply of goods. It is only in cases where the defence is patently dishonest or so unreasonable that it could not reasonably be expected to succeed that the exercise of discretion by the trial court to grant leave unconditionally may be questioned. There is no such ground of interference covered by Section 115 C. P. C.8SUMMARY SUIT UNDER ORDR 37, C. P. C. FOR RECOVERY OF AMOUNTThe cheques were dishonoured in Delhi and more so the demand draft was made payable at Delhi. A part of cause of action having arisen at Delhi, the Delhi courts have the jurisdiction.9In the present case, it is not clear whether the document is an indemnity or a guarantee. In any case there is no unconditional bank-guarantee. Hence leave to defend should have been granted in a summary trial suit under Order 37,CPC 1908.108. M/s. Mechelec Engineers & Manufacturers v.

Sincea portion of the decreed amount is covered by the mortgage, the decree-holder has to proceed against the mortgaged property first and then proceed against the guarantor.But where the decree-holder had proceeded against the mortgaged property and also against the principal debtor, execution against the guarantor is maintainable1.APPLICATION FOR REDEMPTION FILED WITHIN LIMITATION PERIOD — INTIMATION OF — ISSUED THROUGH POST — POSTMAN REPORTED OF NOT FINDING HIM IN THE VILLAGE — DISMISSAL IN DEFAULT — ON THIS POSTAL REPORT — IMPROPER.Where the appellant had made an application for redemption within limitation period. But the postman reported as to the information issued to him through post that he was not found in the village, and the application for redemption was dismissed on this postal report. Held that the application for redemption would be within time in this view of the matter on disregarding the illegal order of dismissal for default. The application for redemption was directed to be taken on file for being disposed of in accordance with law treating the same as within time2.OUTER LIMIT FOR USUFRUCTURY MORTGAGE.Order 34 Rules 7 and 8The order limit for an usufructuary mortgagor for making payment of the amount due under the preliminary decree is passing of the final decree or the date of confirmation of the sale3.SCOPE OF THE RULE.A proceeding is a prescribed course of action for the enforcement of a legal right, e. g., the right of the plaintiff to apply for a final decree. Such right was to be enforced by the making of an application as prescribed by Rule 5 (3) of Order 34, when the High Court by its order stayed all further proceedings in the suit, the effect of it was that the action that would be taken for the passing of a final decree was also stayed. In other words, the filing of an application for a final decree, the court cannot entertain such an application4.APPLICABILITY OF THE RULEOrder XXXIV, Rule 5 Civil Procedure Code is applicable and not the general provision of Section 148 for the jurisdiction for extention of time for deposit of the price of redemption5.NECESSITY FOR FINAL DECREE.In a case where only a money decree has been passed initially a final decree under this rule is not necessary although the decretal amount by sale of the judgment-debtor’s property. Where however the property is charged without payment of the decreetal amount, the proper mode of realising the decreetal amount is to obtain a decree absolute for sale6.COMPETENCY OF COURT.In a mortgage suit the Court by virtue of the provisions contained in order 34 Rule 5(3), Code of Civil Procedure is competent while passing a final decree to direct that the mortgaged property or a sufficient part thereof be sold7.COURT’S OBLIGATION UNDER THE RULEThe Court is bound to set aside the sale under this Rule if the payment has been made before confirmation8.SCOPE OF THE RULEA suit relating to a mortgage should not be dismissed by reason of non-joinder of parties unless the parties are necessary parties and non-joinder affects the merits of the case. If the parties are merely proper parties, as distinguished from necessary parties, the Court may, though the plaintiff refuses to add them as parties, proceed under O. 1 R. 9 to deal with the matter in controversy so far as regards the rights and interests of the parties before it9.SCOPE OF SUIT FOR REDEMPTIONIn a suit for redemption of a mortgage the question of paramount title to the mortgaged property cannot be gone into10.1.

R. 1972 Raj. 203.were undefined and indivisible, failure to bring the legal representatives of the Karta on record would abate the appeal as a whole2.INVOKING POWER OF COURT: CONDITIONS.It is not necessary for provoking power of exemption conferred by sub-rule (4) to move an application within 90 days. Even an application for the said purpose is not required and the Court can by looking into the record itself grant the exemption. The power conferred is on the court, and writing of the same is not a condition precedent for its exercise3.POSITION WHEN SOME LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES ALREADY ON RECORD.If there are several legal representatives, it is sufficient if at least one of them is impleaded under this Rule. A bonafide application within time made for substitution of some of the heirs only is sufficient to keep the suit alive, there is no reason why the same principle should not hold good in a case where some of the heirs are already on record4.ABATEMENT AGAINST SOME RESPONDENTS.This Rule does not provide for the abatement of appeal against corespondents of deceased respondent when the legal representatives are not impleaded. It abates against them in certain circumstances, when it cannot proceed and has to be dismissed. Such result depends on the nature of the relief5.EFFECT OF DEATH OF ONE JOINT TORT-FEASORS.Law is settled that non-substitution of one joint tort-feasor who upon death has left behind legal representatives would lead to the inevitable dismissal of the entire litigation as it would cease to be competent6.WHEN APPEAL DOES NOT ABATE.Where the heir of surety was contesting his liability to satisfy the decretal debt, the appellant claimed no relief against the proforma respondent judgment debtor, by the death of proforma respondent judgment-debtor, right to sue does not revive against him or his heirs and their presence is unnecessary and appeal can proceed in their absence7.2.

C. 503.FAILURE TO BRING LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES OF DECEASED RESPONDENT—WHETHER ABATES A WRIT PETITION ? —(YES).Where in a petition for issuing a certiorari a deceased person was arrayed as one of the respondents, and his legal representatives were not brought on record, though an application had been made for impleading the legal representatives, the fact remains whatever be the person, no order had been made or the application and they were not brought on record as respondents to the petition the writ petition fails on the short ground that the persons who are necessary parties, had not been impleaded as respondents8.NO ABATEMENT ON DEATH OF PROFORMA RESPONDENT.Where a proforma respondent died pending appeal, who claimed no right in property in dispute, the appeal will not abate for not substituting his heirs9.DEATH OF ONE DEFENDANT — WHEN TRIAL CAN PROCEED AGAINST REMAINING DEFENDANTS EVEN ON NON-IMPLEADMENT OF LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES.Where in a suit for ejectment of several trespassers/defendants the interest of the defendants in the suit cannot be said to be joint and indivisible, one defendant dies and his legal representatives not brought on record, the suit can proceed against the remaining defendants. The suit stands abated against the deceased defendant only10.WHEN APPLICATION UNDER THIS RULE NOT REQUIRED.Where the suit was lying stayed and there was no necessity to file any application before revival of suit, there is no question of the condonation of delay in filing the application under this Rule”.SUIT FOR RECOVERY OF MONEY.If it is a personal contract or individual contract & if sole defendant dies & nothing comes to the hands of inter-meddlers, such inter-meddlers are not liable to be substituted as right to sue does not survive in view of Order XXII Rule 4 C.

(date) the court Amin visited the house of the Judgment Debtor to execute warrant of possession.3. That the decree could not be executed due to resistence and obstruction caused by the judgment-debtor and the members of his family.4. That the resistance and obstruction caused by the judgment-debtor and by other members of his family was without any just cause.PRAYERIt is, therefore most respectfully prayed that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to issue notice to the opposite parties and investigation may be ordered to be made in the matter and thereafter orders may be passed to put the applicant in possession of the property.It is accordingly prayed.PlaintiffThrough AdvocatePlace:………………Dated:………………case lawOrder 21 Rule 97LIMITATION FOR PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE RULEArticle 167 of the Limitation Act gives a right to the decree-holder to initiate proceedings under this Rule within 30 days from the date of resistance. The law does not contemplate removal of cause of action or extention of limitation for initiating a proceeding under this Rule merely by putting second or any number of subsequent applications being resisted every time by the same person and initiating a proceeding within 30 days of the second or the last resistance1.LIMITATION IN CASE OF TWO SUCCESSIVE OBSTRUCTIONS.What Article 129 of the Limitation Act of 1983 does is to bar the making of an application about the resistance or obstruction which was made more than 30 days ago. If a second obstruction is made, the complaint is not about the first obstruction but is about the second obstruction and since the law allows the decree-holder to make such an application, it cannot be said that the provisions of Article 129 are made nugatory2.WHAT SHOULD BE STARTING POINT OF LIMITATION.Each obstruction made in execution of warrant for delivery of possession provides a fresh cause of action for filing an application under this Rule3.APPLICABILITY OF THE RULEWhat is required to be shown in order to maintain an obstruction to delivery of property is really possession of the person so obstructing. But proof of such possession would be of no avail unless it is further established that possession was not obtained from or under the judgment-debtor, for if it be otherwise, it would naturally be subject to the result of the suit. Any transaction during pendency of the suit would be hit by the rule of his pendens and therefore possession of person obstructing, based upon his coming into possession pendente lite, would of course be not sufficient. That is why what has to be shown is independent possession4.If an order is passed by an executing Court after 1st February 1977 disposing of an application under this Rule which was pending on that date, the order passed by the executing Court is appealable under the provisions of the amended Code and the aggrieved party has no right to file a suit under the provisions of the Code as it stood before the amendment5.APPEAL AGAINST ORDEROrder under Rule 97 in accordance with Rule 98 is only appealable, and revision is not competent6.NON-MAINTAINABILITY OF OBJECTION BY MINOR SON OF JUDGMENT-DEBTOR.Where the suit for eviction had been decreed and the decree became final, the objection filed by a minor son of the judgment-debtor before execution of the decree would not be maintainable7.EXECUTION PROCEEDINGSOrder 21 Rule 97The suit in respect of same subject matter of property filed after intimation of execution proceedings by appellant who is not a party to the decree is not maintainable.8RECORDING OF COMPROMISEThe order dismissing the execution petition as withdrawn cannot be taken as recording of the compromise by the executing court.91.

That the plaintiff made a will in which she has nominated the applicant and……………….. as the executors.3. That in the interest of justice it is essential that this Honourable Court be pleased to deletion of the name of……………….. permitting substitution of the names of the legatees under the will in her place and making of the necessary consequential amendments in the plaint as detailed below:PRAYERIt is, therefore, respectfully prayed that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to permit the applicant and……………….. to be substituted in place of……………….. after deleting her name and the applicant be permitted to make the amendment in the plaint:(a) That in the title of the plaint the name of the deceased plaintiff ……………….. be ordered to be deleted and in her place the names of the following be permitted to be substituted:1/1……………….. son of……………….. resident of………………..1/2……………….. son of……………….. resident of(b) That in line 1 of para No. 1 of the plaint the words deceased plaintiff was ” be permitted to be substituted in place of the words “plaintiff is” and in line 4 the word “deceased” be permitted to be added before the word “plaintiff.(c) That in para 2 in lines 2, 3 and 4 the word “deceased” be permitted to be added wherever the word “plaintiff occurs and in line 2 the “abuses” be allowed to be substituted by the word “abused” and in line 5 the word “is” be permitted to be substituted by the word “was”.(d) That in line 2 of para 4, in the lines 2 and 4 of para 5, in line 1 of para 6 the word “deceased” be permitted to be added before the word “plaintiff, and in line 1 of para 6 the word “is”, be permitted to be substituted by the word “was”.(e) That after para 6 of the plaint a new para marked as “6A” be permitted to be added as follows:“6A. That the substituted persons viz., Shri………………… and ………… are the legatees of the property of the deceased plaintiff under the will dated………… made by the deceased plaintiff and they are entitled to continue this suit for ejectment of the defendant from the property in suit and recovery of arrears of rent and mesne profits because the right of the deceased plaintiff survives.’’(f) That in the verification clause in second line the words “part of be permitted to be added after figure “6” and before the word “are” and in line 4 the words “part of 6A” be permitted to be added in between figures “6” and “7”.It is accordingly prayed.ApplicantVERIFICATIONVerified that the contents of this application are true to my personal knowledge.Verified and signed on this……………….. day of……………….. 19……………….. at…………………ApplicantThrough AdvocateDated:………………..case lawOrder 22 Rule 3WHEN REFUSING SUBSTITUTION NOT PROPERWhere the delay in making substitution application was of few days only and there was satisfactory explanation for delay in seeking substitution, the HighCourt was held to be in error in refusing substitution in the second appealbefore it’.WHO MAY FILE APPLICATION UNDER THIS RULE.The words employed in this Rule, namely “on an application made in this behalf ” clearly point out that any person may file such an application. Thus a person who purports to be a legal representative of the deceased plaintiff or appellant may file an application for bringing on record the legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff or appellant, although he may be found not to be real legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff, and even then the names of the real representatives of deceased plaintiff may be brought on record if their names have been brought to the notice of the court2.CONSENT DECREE BASED ON ONE VIEW OUT OF TWO POSSIBLE VIEWS NOT LIABLE TO CHALLENGE.Where a compromise decree was passed in appeal, the deed creating religious trust could be constructed to have two views but the compromise was based on one view, it could not be challenged in the subsequent suit on the ground of collusion and fraud3.CONTINUITY OF SUIT ON BASIS OF ORIGINAL SUIT.When during the pendency of a suit the plaintiff dies, and his legal heirs are substituted, they are entitled to continue the suit on the basis of the claim laid by the original plaintiff. They are not entitled to claim independent title of theirs contrary to what has been claimed in the suit4.DISMISSAL OF APPLICATION UNDER THIS RULE ON GROUND OF INSUFFICIENT STAMP ON GENERAL POWER OF ATTORNEY — WHETHER JUSTIFIED? — (NO)Wherein an arbitration proceeding, an application of legal representatives of a deceased party was dismissed on the ground of insufficient stamps on the deed. Held that the document ought to have been admitted in evidence on payment of stamp duty and penalty. The dismissal of the application was unjustified5.APPLICABILITY OF THE RULE TO WRIT PETITIONS.Though the elaborate and technical rules of the Code may not apply to applications under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, on the strength of section 141 of the Code yet the principles in general as laid down in the Code would be applicable on the grounds of justice, equity and good conscience in the matter of impleading the legal representatives6.EFFECT OF BONA FIDE MISTAKE IN NOT SUBSTITUTING ALL HEIRS.In a case of death of a party to a suit or appeal, even if any heir of the deceased is left out of the record and the plaintiff or appellant does not bring him on record in the bona fide belief that others being on record the only heirs, the competence of the suit or appeal will not be effected. It is immaterial whether no steps have been taken within the time allowed7.WHEN APPEAL ABATES AS A WHOLEWhen two of the plaintiff appellants died, the decree of the District Judge became final qua them. If thereafter the High Court granted a decree to the other plaintiffs appellants there would be two contradictory decisions with regard to the right which had been jointly claimed by the plaintiffs. In such a case the second appeal before a single Judge had abated as a whole and the order made by the Judge must be set aside because he could not have heard the appeal and allowed after it had abated8.1.

In such a case, the Court has no alternative but to confirm the sale under Order 21, Rule 92 of the Code1. The Judicial Committee or the Privy Council in dealing with Order 21, Rule 2 held that an adjustment between the decree-holder and the judgment-debtor come at any time before the commission of an execution sale cannot nullify the decree by taking away the very foundation of the Court’s power to execute the decree, viz., the existence of a decree capable of execution1a.SCOPE OF THE RULEIf an auction sale is to be disregarded the adjustment or full satisfaction of the decree must be made under O. 21, R. 2 before the sale. In such a case the sale is altogether void and without jurisdiction and need not, therefore, be set aside and there is no scope for making an application for setting aside the sale2.APPLICABILITY OF THE RULE.The law is clear that this Rule applies to adjustment of a money decree as well and the executing Court is bound to execute the decree even if the decree had been satisfied fully out of Court, unless the action had been certified or recorded by the executing Court in the manner provided by the Rule-3.CONDITIONS FOR APPLICABILITY OF THE RULE.Before the provisions of this Rule can apply, the decree must be a money decree in one form or another. Where the decree is for possession, injunction, etc., pure and simple without there being any direction for payment of money in any shape or form, the provisions of this Rule will have no application4.1.

J. 142.WARRANTS OF RESTORATION OF POSSESSION.Order 21, Rule 32Warrants of restoration of possession can be issued in favour of decree holder under Order 21 Rule 32 CPC.5MEANING OF ‘ADJUSTMENT’.An agreement between decree-holder and judgment-debtor to divide the disputed property and exercise full ownership over the part which was set apart to their respective shares, amounts to adjustment of the decree notwithstanding the executory character of the contract6.APPROPRIATION OF DEPOSIT OF DECREETAL AMOUNT.When the amounts paid by the debtor would be carrying counter interest, a certain portion of the decreetal amount relating to costs and current interest would not be carrying any interest at all. In order to avoid an incorrect result, the proper method that should be adopted is to appropriate the payments made by the judgment debtor first towards costs and interest payable under the decree and if any balance remains after such appropriation towards discharge of the principal amount7.LIMITATION FOR PAYMENT OUT OF COURT AND CERTIFICATION BY DECREE-HOLDER.There is no period of limitation prescribed for a certification by the decree-holder. No particular form of certification has been prescribed. A statement as to payment or adjustment made in column 5 of an execution application is, therefore, a proper certification and the execution Court is not precluded from recognising it under this Rule. The adjustment effected between the parties must be regarded as having been certified by the decree-holder and the Court executing the decree is not barred from recognising it8.EXECUTION PETITION — CIVIL COURT CANNOT REFER MATTER OF IMPLEMENTATION OF DECREE TO POLICE DURING PENDENCYOrder 21 Rule 32In an execution petition under Order 21 which is pending before the Executive5.

C.inSuit No………………… of 19………………………………….A. B…………………………………………………………. PlaintiffversusC. D……………………………………………………… DefendantApplication for restoration of the suit dismissed in default on……………….. 19………………..Sir,The plaintiff most respectfully submits as under:1. That the suit was fixed for………. 19………. for evidence/arguments…………… It was called at 11 a. m. and the plaintiff went to call his counsel Shri……………….. who was not available at his seat at that time, and the plaintiff informed the Court of this fact, and again went to call his counsel, whom he found in Court No………………… arguing another matter and he said to the plaintiff to ask the Court for time upto lunch hours. Accordingly the plaintiff requested the Court to wait till lunch hours. But, however, the learned Court dismissed the suit in default of the plaintiff.2. That in the circumstances it is expedient that the suit be restored to its original number setting aside the ex-pane order aforesaid.PRAYERIt is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that your Honour may be pleased to set aside the ex-pane dismissal order and restore the suit in its original number, and dispute it of on merits after taking evidence and hearing the parties.It is accordingly prayed.ApplicantThroughAdvocatePlace:………………..Dated:………………..Affidavit in support of the application to be filed.CASE LAWOrder 9, Rule 9.WHETHER AN ELECTION PETITION CAN BE RESTORED? —(YES) — WHO CAN FILE PETITION FOR RESTORATION OF AN ELECTION PETITION — (THE PETITIONER HIMSELF AND NOT ANYBODY ELSE).Order 9 Rule 9 of the Code (and not Rule 13) relied by the appellant, would be the relevant provision for restoration of an election petition. That can be invoked in an appropriate case by the election petitioner only and not by a respondent. By its own language, Rule 9 provides that where a suit is wholly or partly dismissed under Rule 8, the plaintiff shall be precluded from bringing a fresh suit but he may apply for an order to set the dismissal aside. Under this rule, therefore, an application for restoration can be made by the petitioner. Since it is a provision for restoration, it is logical that the provision should be applicable only when the party on account of whose default in appearance the petition was dismissed, makes an application to revive the petition to its former stage prior to its dismissal. In the instant case the election petitioner and not the respondent 19 who is in appeal before us, could have asked for the relief of restoration. The appellant contended that the statutory scheme authorises an elector at whose instance an election petition could have been filed to get substituted in the event of withdrawal or abatement and applying that analogy, he urged that a petition for restoration would also lies at the instance of a respondent. The ambit of the provisions relating to withdrawal and abatement cannot be extended to meet other situations. Specific provisions have been made in the Act to deal with the two situations of withdrawal and abatement and a person neither to not a party or one of the respondents who was entitled to file an election petition has been permitted to substitute himself in the election petition and to pursue the same in accordance with law. These provisions cannot be extended to an application under Order 9, Rule 9 of the Code and at the instance of a respondent or any other elector a dismissed petition cannot be restored1.BAR UNDER THE RULE AGAINST LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES.We are however not impressed by the argument that the ban imposed by Order 9, Rule 9 creates merely a personal bar or estoppel against the particular plaintiff suing on the same cause of action and leaves the matter at large for those claiming under him. Beyond the absence in Order 9, Rule 9 of the words referring “to those claiming under the plaintiff there is nothing to warrant this argument. It has neither principle, nor logic to commend it…………………. The rule would obviously have no value and the bar imposed by it would be rendered meaningless if the plaintiff whose suit was dismissed for default had only to transfer the property to another and the latter was able to agitate rights which his vendor was precluded by law from putting forward.In the instant case it was appellant who brought the previous suit which resulted in a decree for eviction of the tenant on July 31, 1961 a date when respondent 1 had already taken possession of the premises by virtue of the transfer made by the Official Liquidator. Thus the identity of the subject-matter being substantially the same, thus case clearly falls within the ambit of the ratio in the case supra. On this ground alone therefore the appellant is entitled to succeed because the High Court with due respect does not appeal to have construed the scope of Order 9, rule 9, C. P. C. properly2.SCOPE OF THE RULE.It is inherent in the constitution of the Court that it may own its mistake and rescind an illegal order which may not be having any sanction of law. The Court can do that as soon as it becomes obvious to it that it passed the order on an erroneous view of law when it was not conscious of the true scope of its own jurisdiction3.An application under 0. 9, R. 9 in a proceeding in a Court of Civil jurisdiction, there is no reason why the procedure provided in regard to suits cannot be made applicable to a proceeding under this Rule. There is no justification to read any such restrictive words in Section 141. The expression “all proceedings” is of a very wide connotation and to restrict it to a proceeding which is original in nature and wholly independent of a suit will be doing violence to the language of the section4.It is true that under O. 9, Rule 9, if the first suit has been dismissed either wholly or partly under Rule 8, the plaintiff would not be permitted for bringing a fresh suit on the same cause of action. He is however entitled to make an application for an order to set aside the dismissal in default of the first suit5.SCOPE OF ENQUIRY UNDER THE RULEThe scope of enquiry in an application under this Rule is confined to questions regarding the service of summons and whether there was any sufficient cause preventing the appearance of the defendant, when the suit was called on for hearing6.APPLICABILITY TO PAUPER APPLICATION.The provisions of Order 9 apply to pauper applications by virtue of Section 141 and a pauper application dismissed for default of appearance of the petitioner can be restored under this Rule7.CONDITION PRECEDENT FOR PASSING ORDER UNDER THIS RULE.In case the Court makes a finding that sufficient cause has not been made out, then only the Court would be in a position to dismiss an application but until that finding is arrived at and if on the contrary there was sufficient cause for non-appearance, the Court would be bound to make an order setting aside the dismissal. In such circumstances there is no question of exercising any option or discretion in the matter8.NON—APPLICABILITY OF THE RULE.The Rule does not apply to applications for probate or letters of Administration9.A judgment in probate proceedings operates as a judgment in rem unlike a judgment in an ordinary suit which operates inter-parties and hence it will not be appropriate to apply the provisions of this Order which are intended to apply to ordinary suits to applications for probate or letters of administration10.NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MAJOR AND MINOR.When a suit is dismissed for default whether the plaintiff is a major or minor, that dismissal can be set aside only on sufficient ground being shown”.When a suit is restored after it was dismissed on ground that neither plaintiff nor defendant has appeared on date fixed, defendant is entitled both in equity and has all right to notice of the date fixed for hearing of the case after its restoration12.Once the court post the case for judgment, there can be no application to recall or advance the hearing for any purpose other than pronouncement of judgment13.SUIT FOR RECOVERY OF MONEY.The document writer cannot be treated as an attesting witness for the will to prove its execution14.1.

That the plaintiff has filed the suit for declaration and permanent injunction in this Hon’ble Court praying therein as under:“It is therefore most respectfully prayed that, this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to grant a decree with costs:(i) Declaring that the defendant’s have no right, title or interest in the land measuring……………. sq. yards out of Khasra No……………. of ………….. in possession and occupation of the plaintiff; and declaring further that the defendant Nos. 1 to 4 have no right in law to eject/ evict the plaintiff therefrom except through the process of law;(ii) Restraining the defendants permanently from interfering with the peaceful possession, occupation, enjoyment and user of the aforesaid property of the plaintiff and by the plaintiff.2. That the defendant’s submit that in the entire plaint not even one word has been stated that the plaintiff is the owner of the disputed area.

That the defendants submit that the suit is also filed against the ……………….. has been made defendant No. 1 and as defendant No. 2. Section 53 B of Delhi Development Act provides as under:“(i) No suit shall be instituted against the Authority, or any member thereof, or any of its Officers or other employees, or any person acting under the directions of the Authority or any member or any Officer or other Employees of the Authority in respect of any Act done or purporting to have been done in pursuance of this Act or any rule or regulation made thereunder until the expiration of two months after notice in writing has been, in the case of the Authority, left at its Office, and in any other case, delivered to, or left at the office or place of abode of, the person to be sued and unless such notice states explicitly the cause of action, the nature of relief sought, the amount of compensation claimed and the name and place of residence of the intending plaintiff and unless the plaint contains a statement that such notice has been so left or delivered.(ii) No Suit such as is described in sub-section (1) shall, unless it is a suit for recovery of immovable property or for a declaration of title thereto, be instituted after the expiry of six months from the date on which the cause of action arises.(iii) Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall be deemed to apply to a suit in which the only relief claimed is an injunction of which the object would be defeated by the giving of the notice or the postponement of the institution of the suit. “4. That similarly Section 478 of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act provides as under:“1. No suit shall be instituted against the Corporation or against any Municipal Authority or against any municipal officer or other municipal employee or against any person acting under the order or direction of any municipal authority or any municipal officer or other municipal employee, in respect of any act done, or purported to have been done, in pursuance of this Act or any rule, regulation or bylaw made thereunder, until the expiration of two months after notice in writing has been left at the Municipal Office and, in the case such Officer, employee or person, unless notice in writing has also been delivered to him or left at his office or place of residence, and unless such notice states explicitly the cause of action, the nature of the relief sought, the amount of compensation claimed, and the name and place of residence of the intending plaintiff, and unless the plaint contains a statement that such notice has been so left or delivered.2. No suit, such as described in sub-section (1), shall unless it is a suit for the recovery of immovable property or for a declaration of title thereto be instituted after the expiry of six months from the date on which the cause of action arise.3. Nothing in sub-section (1) shall be deemed to apply to a suit in which the only relief claimed is an injunction of which the object would be defeated by the giving of the notice or the postponement of the institution of the suit.’’Thus from the aforesaid provisions it will be evident that no suit except for the relief of injunction can be instituted against the Delhi Development Authority and Municipal Corporation of Delhi. It will further be seen that the provisions of the aforesaid Acts are same. The defendants 3 & 4 submit that it is a mandatory requirement of law that no suit shall be instituted against the Delhi Development Authority and Municipal Corporation of Delhi until the expiration of two months after notice in writing has been given and unless such notice states explicitly the cause of action, the nature of relief sought unless the plaint contains a statement that such notice has been so left or delivered.5. That the defendants 3 & 4 submit that the plaint does not contain any averments to the effect that a notice under Section 53 B has been given/served upon the Delhi Development Authority defendant No. 1 and upon Municipal Corporation of Delhi, defendant No. 2, under Section 478 of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act. This being the mandatory requirements, the suit of the plaintiff is liable to be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11.6. That the defendant Nos. 3 & 4 submit that in view of the above facts the suit is not maintainable and liable to be rejected because the notices under the aforesaid provisions having not been given.It is therefore, respectfully prayed that this Hon’ble Court be pleased to reject the plaint of the plaintiff under Order 7 Rule 11. Such other and further Order which this Hon’ble Court deems fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case be also passed.Defendent 3 & 4.PlaintiffThrough  AdvocatePlace: …………………………Dated: …………………………For More Drafts Related To Criminal Proceeding- Link Belowhttps://www.barelaw.in/category/criminal-proceedings/"

    "headline": "Ashoka Kumar Thakur vs Union of India: A Landmark Verdict on OBC Reservations",
    "data": "Introduction: Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of IndiaThe case of Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India is a landmark judgement that delved into the intricacies of social justice and reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBC) in India. This case challenged the Mandal Commission’s classification of 52% of India’s populace as OBC, a figure that was disputed by the National Sample Survey Organisation which estimated it at 42%.Background: In April 2006, the Indian government proposed a constitutional amendment to reserve 27% of seats in higher educational institutions for OBC students, aiming to redress historical social disparities. This decision, however, led to a fierce debate as it reduced the seats for the unreserved category to about 50%. Ashoka Kumar Thakur, in response, filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) challenging the constitutional validity of these amendments.Supreme Court’s Interim Measure: The Supreme Court, while not staying the amendment, decided to delay the implementation of the OBC reservation quota for the academic year 2007-2008, especially in medical and professional institutions. This pause allowed for a deeper examination of the policy’s implications.Judgement: On April 10, 2008, the verdict upheld the 27% OBC reservation in government-funded institutions, introducing the “Creamy Layer” concept to exclude more affluent individuals within the OBC from reservation benefits. This nuanced approach aimed at ensuring that the reservation benefits reach the truly disadvantaged sections within the OBC category.Key Takeaways: The judgement underscored the necessity for a precise identification of OBCs and recommended a more effective commission to handle caste inclusion or exclusion under OBC. It also touched upon various other dimensions such as the necessity of a review mechanism, exclusion criteria for the “Creamy Layer”, and the importance of free and compulsory education for every child.Conclusion: The Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India case has left an indelible mark on the discourse surrounding reservations in India. By affirming the 27% OBC reservation and introducing the “Creamy Layer” concept, it aimed to balance social justice with meritocracy, a debate that continues to shape India’s socio-political landscape."

    "headline": "Revisiting Dina Nath v. Emperor (1913), The Echoes of Pre-Independence Jurisprudence",
    "data": "Dina Nath v. EmperorIn the vast and varied legal history of India, some case laws stand as markers, reflecting the societal and legal norms of their times. One such case is Dina Nath v. Emperor, decided on 31 January 1913 by the Honorable Mr. Justice Tudball at the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad​1​. This case reflects a period in Indian history where the judicial system was under British influence, yet the seeds of Indian legal autonomy were being sown.The case of Dina Nath v. Emperor revolved around the legal intricacies of a certain aspect of the Companies Act, as indicated by a reference to a similar case of Queen-Empress v. Moore​1​. While the specifics of the case are not entirely detailed in the available sources, the reference to the Companies Act hints at a commercial or corporate law matter.The case also touched upon procedural aspects, as noted in a summary trial document, which pointed out the significance of embodying the substance of the evidence in the judgment. It emphasized that a lack of proper detailing in the judgment could vitiate the trial, indicating the importance of thoroughness and accuracy in legal procedures​2​.The case Dina Nath v. Emperor, though over a century old, holds relevance as it showcases the legal practices and judicial approaches of the era. It’s a mirror to the past, reflecting the stringent legal procedures adhered to, even under colonial rule. The reference to the Companies Act underlines the longstanding tradition of corporate law jurisprudence in India, a tradition that has evolved yet continues in the modern Indian legal system.Moreover, the procedural emphasis in the case highlights the enduring importance of evidence and proper documentation in the justice process, a principle that remains crucial in today’s judiciary.Revisiting cases like Dina Nath v. Emperor provides not merely a glimpse into the past but also a continuum that extends into the present legal framework. It underscores the evolution of legal procedures and the enduring principles that underpin the Indian judicial system. Through the lens of such historical cases, one can appreciate the rich tapestry of Indian jurisprudence and the foundational laws and procedures that have shaped it over the decades."

    "headline": "The CBI vs Anupam J. Kulkarni Case",
    "data": "Introduction : CBI vs Anupam J. Kulkarni CaseThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) vs Anupam J. Kulkarni case is a prominent legal case that marked a significant turn in Indian jurisprudence. The verdict, delivered on May 8, 1992, by Justice K Jayachandra Reddy and Justice AM Ahmadi of the Supreme Court of India, reverberated across the legal community, setting forth crucial precedents concerning the rights of arrested individuals and the procedural conduct of law enforcement agencies.Historical Backdrop:The early 1990s was a period of evolving legal interpretations in India, with the judiciary increasingly being called upon to safeguard individual rights against potential overreach by law enforcement agencies. Amidst this backdrop, the case of CBI vs Anupam J. Kulkarni emerged as a touchstone, reflecting the balancing act between law enforcement prerogatives and individual rights.Key Legal Issues:Central to this case were several legal issues that bore broader implications for Indian criminal law. Among them were the validity of the sanction for prosecution, the admissibility of evidence, and the defining role and powers of the CBI in combating corruption and forgery. The case posed complex legal questions, testing the robustness of India’s legal framework in ensuring justice while upholding procedural integrity.Judgment and Legal Interpretation:The judgment of May 8, 1992, underscored a pivotal principle: the necessity to produce an arrested person before a Magistrate within 24 hours of arrest. This directive emanated from a constitutional commitment to protect individuals from unlawful detention and ensure a fair procedural process. The court’s articulation provided a clear legal pathway, ensuring that the rights of arrested individuals were not compromised, thus reinforcing the importance of adhering to procedural mandates.Consequences and Broader Implications:The impact of this judgment was far-reaching. It set a precedent for the timely production of arrestees before a magistrate, a practice instrumental in averting unlawful detentions. The case became a judicial benchmark, guiding law enforcement agencies in aligning their procedures with constitutional guarantees. Moreover, it sparked discussions within the legal community, prompting a closer examination of existing laws and procedures concerning the rights of the accused.The Abduction Incident:A significant aspect of the case narrative was the incident involving the abduction of four diamond merchants in Bombay. This element brought the role of the CBI into sharp focus, as the inquiry into this incident was assigned to them. It underscored the multifaceted challenges faced by law enforcement agencies, and how the legal framework could either facilitate or impede justice.Conclusion:The CBI vs Anupam J. Kulkarni case remains a seminal case in the annals of Indian criminal law. Its enduring relevance lies in its articulation of crucial legal principles and its impact on shaping law enforcement procedures in alignment with constitutional guarantees. As discussions around individual rights and law enforcement practices continue to evolve, the legacy of this case serves as a significant point of reference, reflecting India’s journey in fostering a just and accountable legal system."

But if one reads section 209 and 331 of the U. P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms-Act (I of 1951) together one finds that a suit like the instant one has to be filed before a special court created under the Act within a period of limitation specially prescribed under the Rules made under the Act and the jurisdiction of the ordinary Civil Court is absolutely barred.2SUB-SECTION (2) — APPLICATION OF THE PROVISION TO DELHI HIGH COURT’S ORIGINAL JURISDICTION.Under the Delhi High Court Act, 1966, a suit valuing more than fifty thousand rupees is triable by the High Court in its original side. As such the Delhi High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction in respect of Union Territory of Delhi is competent to try such suit, taking it as a suit of civil nature.3IMPORTANCE OF THE SECTION — APPLICATION OF THE CODE TO REVENUE COURTS — PROVISIONS OF SECTION 104 DO NOT SEEK, LIMIT OR AFFECT THE PROVISIONS OF LETTERS PATENT.The importance of this section is that wherever the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure are sought to be excluded by any special enactment which may be silent on the point, the State Government can by notification apply the provisions of Revenue Courts. All other civil courts would normally be governed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure in the matter of procedure. Section 4(1) of the Code which is a saving provision clearly provides that in the absence of any specific provision to the contrary the provisions of the Code do not limit or affect any special or local law. Thus the test contained in Section 4 is not applicable in the instant case because even if the Letters Patent of the High Court be deemed to be special law as contemplated by Section 4 the provisions of Section 104 do not seek to limit or affect the provisions of the Letters Patent.4APPLICATION OF THE CODE TO REVENUE COURTS — JURISDICTION OF ORDINARY CIVIL COURT WHEN BARRED.The Supreme Court had laid down:No doubt if the suit is one properly entertainable by the Civil Court the period of limitation must be governed by the provisions of the Limitation Act and no other. But if one reads section 209 and 331 of the U. P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act (I of 1951) together one finds that a suit like the instant one has to be filed before a special court created under the Act within a period of limitation specially prescribed under the Rules made under the Act and the jurisdiction of the ordinary Civil Court is absolutely barred.51.

C. If the additional evidence was allowed to be adduced contrary to the principles governing the reception of such evidence, it would be a case of improper exercise of discretion, and the additional evidence so brought on the record will haveto he ignored and the case decided as it was non-existent. Under O. 41, Rule 27, it is the appellate court that must require the evidence to enable it to pronounce judgment. As laid down by the Privy Council in the well-known case1.“The legitimate occasion for the application of the present rule is, when on examining the evidence, as it stands, some inherent lacuna or defect becomes apparent, not where a discovery is made, outside the court, of fresh evidence and application is made to import it. ” And they reiterated this view in stronger terms even in the later case2. The true test, therefore, is whether the appellate court is able to pronounce judgment on the materials before it without taking into consideration the additional evidence sought to be adduced3.ADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE—WHEN CAN BE REFUSED? (MANY YEARS AFTER FILING SUIT).Before the High Court, Pramod Kumari filed an application for reception of additional evidence. The principal additional evidence sought to be adduced was an alleged letter said to have been written by late Pearey Lal Singh to the bank nominating Pramod Kumari as the person entitled to the amount in deposit with the bank. The letter itself was not filed along with the application but a request was made to summon the letter from the bank. The High Court rejected the application. The application to the High Court was made very many years after the suit had been filed, and also quite some years after the appeal had been filed before the High Court, and we do not think that we will be justified in interfering with the discretion exercised by the High Court in refusing to receive additional evidence at that stage. The appeal is therefore dismissed but in the circumstances with no order as to costs4.POWER OF HIGH COURT UNDER SECTION 115 CPCOrder 41, Rule 27, Section 15The High Court in exercise of its power under Section 115, CPC, could not interfere with an order of appellate Court rejecting permission to adduce additional evidence particularly when the whole appeal is not before the High Court.5ADDITIONAL EVIDENCEOrder 41, Rule 27Section 107, CPC enables an appellate Court to take additional evidence or to require such other evidence to be taken subject to such conditions and limitations as are prescribed under Order XII, Rule 27, CPC.51.

That a decree for possession of the property mentioned in the decree dated ……………….. of this Hon’ble Court was passed in favour of the applicant against the judgment-debtor.2. That on……………….. (date) the applicant obtained from this Hon’ble Court a warrant for possession of the house of the judgment-debtor and on ……………….. (date) the court Amin visited the house of the Judgment Debtor to execute warrant of possession.3. That the decree could not be executed due to resistence and obstruction caused by the judgment-debtor and the members of his family.4. That the resistance and obstruction caused by the judgment-debtor and by other members of his family was without any just cause.PRAYERIt is, therefore most respectfully prayed that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to issue notice to the opposite parties and investigation may be ordered to be made in the matter and thereafter orders may be passed to put the applicant in possession of the property.It is accordingly prayed.PlaintiffThrough AdvocatePlace:………………Dated:………………case lawOrder 21 Rule 97LIMITATION FOR PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE RULEArticle 167 of the Limitation Act gives a right to the decree-holder to initiate proceedings under this Rule within 30 days from the date of resistance. The law does not contemplate removal of cause of action or extention of limitation for initiating a proceeding under this Rule merely by putting second or any number of subsequent applications being resisted every time by the same person and initiating a proceeding within 30 days of the second or the last resistance1.LIMITATION IN CASE OF TWO SUCCESSIVE OBSTRUCTIONS.What Article 129 of the Limitation Act of 1983 does is to bar the making of an application about the resistance or obstruction which was made more than 30 days ago. If a second obstruction is made, the complaint is not about the first obstruction but is about the second obstruction and since the law allows the decree-holder to make such an application, it cannot be said that the provisions of Article 129 are made nugatory2.WHAT SHOULD BE STARTING POINT OF LIMITATION.Each obstruction made in execution of warrant for delivery of possession provides a fresh cause of action for filing an application under this Rule3.APPLICABILITY OF THE RULEWhat is required to be shown in order to maintain an obstruction to delivery of property is really possession of the person so obstructing. But proof of such possession would be of no avail unless it is further established that possession was not obtained from or under the judgment-debtor, for if it be otherwise, it would naturally be subject to the result of the suit. Any transaction during pendency of the suit would be hit by the rule of his pendens and therefore possession of person obstructing, based upon his coming into possession pendente lite, would of course be not sufficient. That is why what has to be shown is independent possession4.If an order is passed by an executing Court after 1st February 1977 disposing of an application under this Rule which was pending on that date, the order passed by the executing Court is appealable under the provisions of the amended Code and the aggrieved party has no right to file a suit under the provisions of the Code as it stood before the amendment5.APPEAL AGAINST ORDEROrder under Rule 97 in accordance with Rule 98 is only appealable, and revision is not competent6.NON-MAINTAINABILITY OF OBJECTION BY MINOR SON OF JUDGMENT-DEBTOR.Where the suit for eviction had been decreed and the decree became final, the objection filed by a minor son of the judgment-debtor before execution of the decree would not be maintainable7.EXECUTION PROCEEDINGSOrder 21 Rule 97The suit in respect of same subject matter of property filed after intimation of execution proceedings by appellant who is not a party to the decree is not maintainable.8RECORDING OF COMPROMISEThe order dismissing the execution petition as withdrawn cannot be taken as recording of the compromise by the executing court.91.
