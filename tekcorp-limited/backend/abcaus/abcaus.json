The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Disallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT Act with respect to by-product/exempt goods – Supreme Court allows ITCABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3813 (2023) (11) SCImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:State of Karnataka v. M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Also the calculator is meant only for tangible assets. Like, in last year useful life of the assets purchased during the FY 2022-23 is taken in integers only.Any error or suggestions may please be reported at lohni@yahoo.comPlease note that while downloading this utility save it as either Excel 97-2003 (xls) or Macro Enabled sheet in Excel 2007 or later versions (.xlsm) Only The calculator has been divided into five part as under: (a) Assets (b) Opening Details (c) Additions (d) Opening Deletions, and (e) Depreciation Chart In each part only “grey” fields are required to be filled.Assets database should be created by providing names of the assets and by selecting the asset type as per schedule-II. Please note that no two names should be identical. If for example there are multiple computers, they should be written in different rows as computer1, computer2…and so on.Since, you must be having the individual asset-wise list of closing wdv as on 31/03/2021 or the depreciated value of the asset as on 31/03/2014 (for SLM purposes) creating this database should not be a problem.Please note that new assets purchased during FY 2022-23 should also be filled in this database. Again, please bear in mind that they should also be unique and not bear an identical name to an existing asset.For example:You have opening wdv of the block furniture individually for each asset (say, “furniture1”, “furniture2”, “furniture3”) and if during FY 2022-23 there is another addition to the block furniture, then a new nomenclature (say, “furniture4”) should be used in the asset sheet. In the “new addition sheet” this new furniture “Furniture4” is required to be selected for calculating depreciation on new additions.Since the users must be having individual asset wise closing wdv as on 31/03/2022, the details required in the opening sheet should be filled using the wdv list as on 31/03/2022.For SLM purposes, depreciated book value of the assets should be filled in column B.In the Opening WorkSheet, the following particulars are required to be given:Name of assets > fill the “Asset Sheet” as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22 and select by drop downDepreciated value of asset as on 01/04/2014 (if using SLM)WDV as on 01-04-2022 > as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22.

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do. Whether to continue existing payments towards insurance premium, provident fund etc. or whether defer their housing loan etc. The helpless individual taxpayers which do not have access to a tax expert are finding hard to determine which tax regime is beneficial to them.The ABCAUS Excel calculator compares tax incidence under the existing tax regime and the proposed New Simplified Personal Tax Regime and attempts to provide a handy tool to the taxpayers to choose their course of action in future.(Upldated on 26/06/2023)Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Excel Form 10E-Salary Arrears Relief calculator AY 2023-24 (FY 2022-23) for claiming rebate under section 89(1) of Income Tax Act 1961-DownloadAs per section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relief for income tax has been provided when in a financial year an employee receives salary in arrears or advance. As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Nageswara Rao vs. Dy. CITIncome Tax Officer vs. Orchid Griha Nirman (P) Ltd reported in (2022) 134 Taxmann.com 281 (Cal.)CIT vs. Sundaram Iyengar & Sons (P) Limited (1975) 101 ITR 764 (SC)Keshavji Ravji & Co. vs. CIT (1990) 183 ITR 1 (SC)UOI vs. Kamlakshi Finance Corporation Ltd. 1992 taxmann.com 16 (SC)DLF Universal vs. DCIT (2010) 123 ITD 0001Sunil Siddharthbhai vs. CIT (1985) 156 ITR 509 (S.C)In the instant case, the assessee had challenged the order passed by the CIT(A) in confirming addition of capital gain u/s 45(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) on account of transfer of land as capital contribution in partnership firm.The Assessing Officer during the course of assessement proceedings noted that the assessee had acquired some land which he had transferred as capital contribution to his partnership firm under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for construction of multi-storied residential apartment complex.It was observed that assessee before the transfer first revalued the land and transferred the land at revalued price to the firm. The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Addition for bogus capital gain in penny stock company deleted as shares were purchased and sold before order of SEBI and investigation reportABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3814 (2023) (11) ITATImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:Karuna Garg and OthersIn the instant case, the assessee had challenged the order passed by the CIT(A) in confirming denial of exemption claimed u/s 10(38) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) in respect of long term capital gain earned on sale of listed equity sharesDuring the course of scrutiny assessment proceedings, the Assessing Officer noticed that the assessee had shown long term capital gain on sale of shares of a listed company which was claimed to be exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.From the report of the Directorate of Investigation, the Assessing Officer formed a belief that the impugned long term capital gains were result of transaction in penny stock.The Investigation Wing had elaborately discussed the modus operandi adopted by the operators, which was to make the beneficiary buy some shares of a pre-determined penny stock company controlled by them. These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Also the calculator is meant only for tangible assets. Like, in last year useful life of the assets purchased during the FY 2022-23 is taken in integers only.Any error or suggestions may please be reported at lohni@yahoo.comPlease note that while downloading this utility save it as either Excel 97-2003 (xls) or Macro Enabled sheet in Excel 2007 or later versions (.xlsm) Only The calculator has been divided into five part as under: (a) Assets (b) Opening Details (c) Additions (d) Opening Deletions, and (e) Depreciation Chart In each part only “grey” fields are required to be filled.Assets database should be created by providing names of the assets and by selecting the asset type as per schedule-II. Please note that no two names should be identical. If for example there are multiple computers, they should be written in different rows as computer1, computer2…and so on.Since, you must be having the individual asset-wise list of closing wdv as on 31/03/2021 or the depreciated value of the asset as on 31/03/2014 (for SLM purposes) creating this database should not be a problem.Please note that new assets purchased during FY 2022-23 should also be filled in this database. Again, please bear in mind that they should also be unique and not bear an identical name to an existing asset.For example:You have opening wdv of the block furniture individually for each asset (say, “furniture1”, “furniture2”, “furniture3”) and if during FY 2022-23 there is another addition to the block furniture, then a new nomenclature (say, “furniture4”) should be used in the asset sheet. In the “new addition sheet” this new furniture “Furniture4” is required to be selected for calculating depreciation on new additions.Since the users must be having individual asset wise closing wdv as on 31/03/2022, the details required in the opening sheet should be filled using the wdv list as on 31/03/2022.For SLM purposes, depreciated book value of the assets should be filled in column B.In the Opening WorkSheet, the following particulars are required to be given:Name of assets > fill the “Asset Sheet” as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22 and select by drop downDepreciated value of asset as on 01/04/2014 (if using SLM)WDV as on 01-04-2022 > as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22.

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do. Whether to continue existing payments towards insurance premium, provident fund etc. or whether defer their housing loan etc. The helpless individual taxpayers which do not have access to a tax expert are finding hard to determine which tax regime is beneficial to them.The ABCAUS Excel calculator compares tax incidence under the existing tax regime and the proposed New Simplified Personal Tax Regime and attempts to provide a handy tool to the taxpayers to choose their course of action in future.(Upldated on 26/06/2023)Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Excel Form 10E-Salary Arrears Relief calculator AY 2023-24 (FY 2022-23) for claiming rebate under section 89(1) of Income Tax Act 1961-DownloadAs per section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relief for income tax has been provided when in a financial year an employee receives salary in arrears or advance. As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Disallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT Act with respect to by-product/exempt goods – Supreme Court allows ITCABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3813 (2023) (11) SCImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:State of Karnataka v. M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Also the calculator is meant only for tangible assets. Like, in last year useful life of the assets purchased during the FY 2022-23 is taken in integers only.Any error or suggestions may please be reported at lohni@yahoo.comPlease note that while downloading this utility save it as either Excel 97-2003 (xls) or Macro Enabled sheet in Excel 2007 or later versions (.xlsm) Only The calculator has been divided into five part as under: (a) Assets (b) Opening Details (c) Additions (d) Opening Deletions, and (e) Depreciation Chart In each part only “grey” fields are required to be filled.Assets database should be created by providing names of the assets and by selecting the asset type as per schedule-II. Please note that no two names should be identical. If for example there are multiple computers, they should be written in different rows as computer1, computer2…and so on.Since, you must be having the individual asset-wise list of closing wdv as on 31/03/2021 or the depreciated value of the asset as on 31/03/2014 (for SLM purposes) creating this database should not be a problem.Please note that new assets purchased during FY 2022-23 should also be filled in this database. Again, please bear in mind that they should also be unique and not bear an identical name to an existing asset.For example:You have opening wdv of the block furniture individually for each asset (say, “furniture1”, “furniture2”, “furniture3”) and if during FY 2022-23 there is another addition to the block furniture, then a new nomenclature (say, “furniture4”) should be used in the asset sheet. In the “new addition sheet” this new furniture “Furniture4” is required to be selected for calculating depreciation on new additions.Since the users must be having individual asset wise closing wdv as on 31/03/2022, the details required in the opening sheet should be filled using the wdv list as on 31/03/2022.For SLM purposes, depreciated book value of the assets should be filled in column B.In the Opening WorkSheet, the following particulars are required to be given:Name of assets > fill the “Asset Sheet” as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22 and select by drop downDepreciated value of asset as on 01/04/2014 (if using SLM)WDV as on 01-04-2022 > as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22.

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do.

    "data": "Excel Form 10E-Salary Arrears Relief calculator AY 2023-24 (FY 2022-23) for claiming rebate under section 89(1) of Income Tax Act 1961-DownloadAs per section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relief for income tax has been provided when in a financial year an employee receives salary in arrears or advance. As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Addition for bogus capital gain in penny stock company deleted as shares were purchased and sold before order of SEBI and investigation reportABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3814 (2023) (11) ITATImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:Karuna Garg and OthersIn the instant case, the assessee had challenged the order passed by the CIT(A) in confirming denial of exemption claimed u/s 10(38) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) in respect of long term capital gain earned on sale of listed equity sharesDuring the course of scrutiny assessment proceedings, the Assessing Officer noticed that the assessee had shown long term capital gain on sale of shares of a listed company which was claimed to be exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.From the report of the Directorate of Investigation, the Assessing Officer formed a belief that the impugned long term capital gains were result of transaction in penny stock.The Investigation Wing had elaborately discussed the modus operandi adopted by the operators, which was to make the beneficiary buy some shares of a pre-determined penny stock company controlled by them. These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Disallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT Act with respect to by-product/exempt goods – Supreme Court allows ITCABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3813 (2023) (11) SCImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:State of Karnataka v. M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Also the calculator is meant only for tangible assets. Like, in last year useful life of the assets purchased during the FY 2022-23 is taken in integers only.Any error or suggestions may please be reported at lohni@yahoo.comPlease note that while downloading this utility save it as either Excel 97-2003 (xls) or Macro Enabled sheet in Excel 2007 or later versions (.xlsm) Only The calculator has been divided into five part as under: (a) Assets (b) Opening Details (c) Additions (d) Opening Deletions, and (e) Depreciation Chart In each part only “grey” fields are required to be filled.Assets database should be created by providing names of the assets and by selecting the asset type as per schedule-II. Please note that no two names should be identical. If for example there are multiple computers, they should be written in different rows as computer1, computer2…and so on.Since, you must be having the individual asset-wise list of closing wdv as on 31/03/2021 or the depreciated value of the asset as on 31/03/2014 (for SLM purposes) creating this database should not be a problem.Please note that new assets purchased during FY 2022-23 should also be filled in this database. Again, please bear in mind that they should also be unique and not bear an identical name to an existing asset.For example:You have opening wdv of the block furniture individually for each asset (say, “furniture1”, “furniture2”, “furniture3”) and if during FY 2022-23 there is another addition to the block furniture, then a new nomenclature (say, “furniture4”) should be used in the asset sheet. In the “new addition sheet” this new furniture “Furniture4” is required to be selected for calculating depreciation on new additions.Since the users must be having individual asset wise closing wdv as on 31/03/2022, the details required in the opening sheet should be filled using the wdv list as on 31/03/2022.For SLM purposes, depreciated book value of the assets should be filled in column B.In the Opening WorkSheet, the following particulars are required to be given:Name of assets > fill the “Asset Sheet” as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22 and select by drop downDepreciated value of asset as on 01/04/2014 (if using SLM)WDV as on 01-04-2022 > as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22.

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do. Whether to continue existing payments towards insurance premium, provident fund etc. or whether defer their housing loan etc. The helpless individual taxpayers which do not have access to a tax expert are finding hard to determine which tax regime is beneficial to them.The ABCAUS Excel calculator compares tax incidence under the existing tax regime and the proposed New Simplified Personal Tax Regime and attempts to provide a handy tool to the taxpayers to choose their course of action in future.(Upldated on 26/06/2023)Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Excel Form 10E-Salary Arrears Relief calculator AY 2023-24 (FY 2022-23) for claiming rebate under section 89(1) of Income Tax Act 1961-DownloadAs per section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relief for income tax has been provided when in a financial year an employee receives salary in arrears or advance. As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Nageswara Rao vs. Dy. CITIncome Tax Officer vs. Orchid Griha Nirman (P) Ltd reported in (2022) 134 Taxmann.com 281 (Cal.)CIT vs. Sundaram Iyengar & Sons (P) Limited (1975) 101 ITR 764 (SC)Keshavji Ravji & Co. vs. CIT (1990) 183 ITR 1 (SC)UOI vs. Kamlakshi Finance Corporation Ltd. 1992 taxmann.com 16 (SC)DLF Universal vs. DCIT (2010) 123 ITD 0001Sunil Siddharthbhai vs. CIT (1985) 156 ITR 509 (S.C)In the instant case, the assessee had challenged the order passed by the CIT(A) in confirming addition of capital gain u/s 45(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) on account of transfer of land as capital contribution in partnership firm.The Assessing Officer during the course of assessement proceedings noted that the assessee had acquired some land which he had transferred as capital contribution to his partnership firm under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for construction of multi-storied residential apartment complex.It was observed that assessee before the transfer first revalued the land and transferred the land at revalued price to the firm. The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Also the calculator is meant only for tangible assets. Like, in last year useful life of the assets purchased during the FY 2022-23 is taken in integers only.Any error or suggestions may please be reported at lohni@yahoo.comPlease note that while downloading this utility save it as either Excel 97-2003 (xls) or Macro Enabled sheet in Excel 2007 or later versions (.xlsm) Only The calculator has been divided into five part as under: (a) Assets (b) Opening Details (c) Additions (d) Opening Deletions, and (e) Depreciation Chart In each part only “grey” fields are required to be filled.Assets database should be created by providing names of the assets and by selecting the asset type as per schedule-II. Please note that no two names should be identical. If for example there are multiple computers, they should be written in different rows as computer1, computer2…and so on.Since, you must be having the individual asset-wise list of closing wdv as on 31/03/2021 or the depreciated value of the asset as on 31/03/2014 (for SLM purposes) creating this database should not be a problem.Please note that new assets purchased during FY 2022-23 should also be filled in this database. Again, please bear in mind that they should also be unique and not bear an identical name to an existing asset.For example:You have opening wdv of the block furniture individually for each asset (say, “furniture1”, “furniture2”, “furniture3”) and if during FY 2022-23 there is another addition to the block furniture, then a new nomenclature (say, “furniture4”) should be used in the asset sheet. In the “new addition sheet” this new furniture “Furniture4” is required to be selected for calculating depreciation on new additions.Since the users must be having individual asset wise closing wdv as on 31/03/2022, the details required in the opening sheet should be filled using the wdv list as on 31/03/2022.For SLM purposes, depreciated book value of the assets should be filled in column B.In the Opening WorkSheet, the following particulars are required to be given:Name of assets > fill the “Asset Sheet” as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22 and select by drop downDepreciated value of asset as on 01/04/2014 (if using SLM)WDV as on 01-04-2022 > as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22.

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do. Whether to continue existing payments towards insurance premium, provident fund etc. or whether defer their housing loan etc. The helpless individual taxpayers which do not have access to a tax expert are finding hard to determine which tax regime is beneficial to them.The ABCAUS Excel calculator compares tax incidence under the existing tax regime and the proposed New Simplified Personal Tax Regime and attempts to provide a handy tool to the taxpayers to choose their course of action in future.(Upldated on 26/06/2023)Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Excel Form 10E-Salary Arrears Relief calculator AY 2023-24 (FY 2022-23) for claiming rebate under section 89(1) of Income Tax Act 1961-DownloadAs per section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relief for income tax has been provided when in a financial year an employee receives salary in arrears or advance. As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel.

It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "ABCAUS Excel Depreciation Calculator FY 2022-23 under Companies Act 2013 as per Schedule-II Version 04.26The maiden ABCAUS Excel Companies Act 2013 Depreciation Calculator was first launched in March, 2015. The ABCAUS Depreciation calculator for FY 2022-23 has also been formulated and styled the same way as its predecessor so that users find themselves familiar with it.This calculator is meant for companies following April to March Financial year. Also the calculator is meant only for tangible assets. Like, in last year useful life of the assets purchased during the FY 2022-23 is taken in integers only.Any error or suggestions may please be reported at lohni@yahoo.comPlease note that while downloading this utility save it as either Excel 97-2003 (xls) or Macro Enabled sheet in Excel 2007 or later versions (.xlsm) Only The calculator has been divided into five part as under: (a) Assets (b) Opening Details (c) Additions (d) Opening Deletions, and (e) Depreciation Chart In each part only “grey” fields are required to be filled.Assets database should be created by providing names of the assets and by selecting the asset type as per schedule-II. Please note that no two names should be identical. If for example there are multiple computers, they should be written in different rows as computer1, computer2…and so on.Since, you must be having the individual asset-wise list of closing wdv as on 31/03/2021 or the depreciated value of the asset as on 31/03/2014 (for SLM purposes) creating this database should not be a problem.Please note that new assets purchased during FY 2022-23 should also be filled in this database. Again, please bear in mind that they should also be unique and not bear an identical name to an existing asset.For example:You have opening wdv of the block furniture individually for each asset (say, “furniture1”, “furniture2”, “furniture3”) and if during FY 2022-23 there is another addition to the block furniture, then a new nomenclature (say, “furniture4”) should be used in the asset sheet. In the “new addition sheet” this new furniture “Furniture4” is required to be selected for calculating depreciation on new additions.Since the users must be having individual asset wise closing wdv as on 31/03/2022, the details required in the opening sheet should be filled using the wdv list as on 31/03/2022.For SLM purposes, depreciated book value of the assets should be filled in column B.In the Opening WorkSheet, the following particulars are required to be given:Name of assets > fill the “Asset Sheet” as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22 and select by drop downDepreciated value of asset as on 01/04/2014 (if using SLM)WDV as on 01-04-2022 > as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22. If useful life of the asset was zero as on 01/04/2014 it would be equal to the residual value.Remaining useful life > as per useful life as on 01/04/2014 minus three yearsIf useful life zero as on 01/04/2014 > Select Yes or NoIf asset has been sold during FY 2022-23 > select Yes or No from drop downEstimated residual value > as estimated during FY 2014-15. By default it was taken 5%Depreciation Rate > The rate as calculated in FY 2014-15 should be filledRest of the values shall be calculated automaticallyDate of format should be dd/mm/yyyyNo field should be left blank.Date of format should be dd/mm/yyyyFor each new additions, first they should be created in ‘Assets” sheet.For new additions made during the year, residual value has been taken @ 5% by default.If any disposal has been made out of additions during the year, its details must be filled in columns ‘f” and “g” after selecting “Yes” in column “e”Please note that useful lives of assets can be altered from the sheet useful life.This sheet accounts for any deletion that has been made out of the opening assets, (i.e.; out of opening sheet)Only those assets which have been disposed off during FY 2022-23 should be selected under assets name list.If you have selected “yes” against any asset in column “f” in opening sheet, the same asset must be selected hereDate of format should be dd/mm/yyyyDate of purchase of disposed asset should be available as per depreciation chart prepared for FY 2014-15.This sheet must be filled after completing the ‘Opening sheet” Depreciation ChartIt should be automatically calculated.&lt;br /&gt;The calculator is meant to guide and help in calculating the depreciation, the disclosure requirements have to be separately taken care of.Also the WDV written off should be charged either to reserves and surplus or profit and loss account.

    "data": "Excel Calculator to compare Tax under existing / old and new Personal Tax Regime u/s 115BAC for AY 2024-25 (FY 2023-24)Excel Calculator to compare Tax under existing and new Personal Tax Regime u/s 115BAC. Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do. Whether to continue existing payments towards insurance premium, provident fund etc. or whether defer their housing loan etc. The helpless individual taxpayers which do not have access to a tax expert are finding hard to determine which tax regime is beneficial to them.The ABCAUS Excel calculator compares tax incidence under the existing tax regime and the proposed New Simplified Personal Tax Regime and attempts to provide a handy tool to the taxpayers to choose their course of action in future.(Upldated on 26/06/2023)Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT.

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Addition for bogus capital gain in penny stock company deleted as shares were purchased and sold before order of SEBI and investigation reportABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3814 (2023) (11) ITATImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:Karuna Garg and OthersIn the instant case, the assessee had challenged the order passed by the CIT(A) in confirming denial of exemption claimed u/s 10(38) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) in respect of long term capital gain earned on sale of listed equity sharesDuring the course of scrutiny assessment proceedings, the Assessing Officer noticed that the assessee had shown long term capital gain on sale of shares of a listed company which was claimed to be exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.From the report of the Directorate of Investigation, the Assessing Officer formed a belief that the impugned long term capital gains were result of transaction in penny stock.The Investigation Wing had elaborately discussed the modus operandi adopted by the operators, which was to make the beneficiary buy some shares of a pre-determined penny stock company controlled by them. These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do. Whether to continue existing payments towards insurance premium, provident fund etc. or whether defer their housing loan etc. The helpless individual taxpayers which do not have access to a tax expert are finding hard to determine which tax regime is beneficial to them.The ABCAUS Excel calculator compares tax incidence under the existing tax regime and the proposed New Simplified Personal Tax Regime and attempts to provide a handy tool to the taxpayers to choose their course of action in future.(Upldated on 26/06/2023)Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do. Whether to continue existing payments towards insurance premium, provident fund etc. or whether defer their housing loan etc. The helpless individual taxpayers which do not have access to a tax expert are finding hard to determine which tax regime is beneficial to them.The ABCAUS Excel calculator compares tax incidence under the existing tax regime and the proposed New Simplified Personal Tax Regime and attempts to provide a handy tool to the taxpayers to choose their course of action in future.(Upldated on 26/06/2023)Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Excel Form 10E-Salary Arrears Relief calculator AY 2023-24 (FY 2022-23) for claiming rebate under section 89(1) of Income Tax Act 1961-DownloadAs per section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relief for income tax has been provided when in a financial year an employee receives salary in arrears or advance. As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Nageswara Rao vs. Dy. CITIncome Tax Officer vs. Orchid Griha Nirman (P) Ltd reported in (2022) 134 Taxmann.com 281 (Cal.)CIT vs. Sundaram Iyengar & Sons (P) Limited (1975) 101 ITR 764 (SC)Keshavji Ravji & Co. vs. CIT (1990) 183 ITR 1 (SC)UOI vs. Kamlakshi Finance Corporation Ltd. 1992 taxmann.com 16 (SC)DLF Universal vs. DCIT (2010) 123 ITD 0001Sunil Siddharthbhai vs. CIT (1985) 156 ITR 509 (S.C)In the instant case, the assessee had challenged the order passed by the CIT(A) in confirming addition of capital gain u/s 45(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) on account of transfer of land as capital contribution in partnership firm.The Assessing Officer during the course of assessement proceedings noted that the assessee had acquired some land which he had transferred as capital contribution to his partnership firm under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for construction of multi-storied residential apartment complex.It was observed that assessee before the transfer first revalued the land and transferred the land at revalued price to the firm. The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "ABCAUS Excel Depreciation Calculator FY 2022-23 under Companies Act 2013 as per Schedule-II Version 04.26The maiden ABCAUS Excel Companies Act 2013 Depreciation Calculator was first launched in March, 2015. The ABCAUS Depreciation calculator for FY 2022-23 has also been formulated and styled the same way as its predecessor so that users find themselves familiar with it.This calculator is meant for companies following April to March Financial year. Also the calculator is meant only for tangible assets. Like, in last year useful life of the assets purchased during the FY 2022-23 is taken in integers only.Any error or suggestions may please be reported at lohni@yahoo.comPlease note that while downloading this utility save it as either Excel 97-2003 (xls) or Macro Enabled sheet in Excel 2007 or later versions (.xlsm) Only The calculator has been divided into five part as under: (a) Assets (b) Opening Details (c) Additions (d) Opening Deletions, and (e) Depreciation Chart In each part only “grey” fields are required to be filled.Assets database should be created by providing names of the assets and by selecting the asset type as per schedule-II. Please note that no two names should be identical. If for example there are multiple computers, they should be written in different rows as computer1, computer2…and so on.Since, you must be having the individual asset-wise list of closing wdv as on 31/03/2021 or the depreciated value of the asset as on 31/03/2014 (for SLM purposes) creating this database should not be a problem.Please note that new assets purchased during FY 2022-23 should also be filled in this database. Again, please bear in mind that they should also be unique and not bear an identical name to an existing asset.For example:You have opening wdv of the block furniture individually for each asset (say, “furniture1”, “furniture2”, “furniture3”) and if during FY 2022-23 there is another addition to the block furniture, then a new nomenclature (say, “furniture4”) should be used in the asset sheet. In the “new addition sheet” this new furniture “Furniture4” is required to be selected for calculating depreciation on new additions.Since the users must be having individual asset wise closing wdv as on 31/03/2022, the details required in the opening sheet should be filled using the wdv list as on 31/03/2022.For SLM purposes, depreciated book value of the assets should be filled in column B.In the Opening WorkSheet, the following particulars are required to be given:Name of assets > fill the “Asset Sheet” as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22 and select by drop downDepreciated value of asset as on 01/04/2014 (if using SLM)WDV as on 01-04-2022 > as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22. If useful life of the asset was zero as on 01/04/2014 it would be equal to the residual value.Remaining useful life > as per useful life as on 01/04/2014 minus three yearsIf useful life zero as on 01/04/2014 > Select Yes or NoIf asset has been sold during FY 2022-23 > select Yes or No from drop downEstimated residual value > as estimated during FY 2014-15.

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do. Whether to continue existing payments towards insurance premium, provident fund etc. or whether defer their housing loan etc. The helpless individual taxpayers which do not have access to a tax expert are finding hard to determine which tax regime is beneficial to them.The ABCAUS Excel calculator compares tax incidence under the existing tax regime and the proposed New Simplified Personal Tax Regime and attempts to provide a handy tool to the taxpayers to choose their course of action in future.(Upldated on 26/06/2023)Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Excel Form 10E-Salary Arrears Relief calculator AY 2023-24 (FY 2022-23) for claiming rebate under section 89(1) of Income Tax Act 1961-DownloadAs per section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relief for income tax has been provided when in a financial year an employee receives salary in arrears or advance. As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Disallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT Act with respect to by-product/exempt goods – Supreme Court allows ITCABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3813 (2023) (11) SCImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:State of Karnataka v. M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do. Whether to continue existing payments towards insurance premium, provident fund etc. or whether defer their housing loan etc. The helpless individual taxpayers which do not have access to a tax expert are finding hard to determine which tax regime is beneficial to them.The ABCAUS Excel calculator compares tax incidence under the existing tax regime and the proposed New Simplified Personal Tax Regime and attempts to provide a handy tool to the taxpayers to choose their course of action in future.(Upldated on 26/06/2023)Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Nageswara Rao vs. Dy. CITIncome Tax Officer vs. Orchid Griha Nirman (P) Ltd reported in (2022) 134 Taxmann.com 281 (Cal.)CIT vs. Sundaram Iyengar & Sons (P) Limited (1975) 101 ITR 764 (SC)Keshavji Ravji & Co. vs. CIT (1990) 183 ITR 1 (SC)UOI vs. Kamlakshi Finance Corporation Ltd. 1992 taxmann.com 16 (SC)DLF Universal vs. DCIT (2010) 123 ITD 0001Sunil Siddharthbhai vs. CIT (1985) 156 ITR 509 (S.C)In the instant case, the assessee had challenged the order passed by the CIT(A) in confirming addition of capital gain u/s 45(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) on account of transfer of land as capital contribution in partnership firm.The Assessing Officer during the course of assessement proceedings noted that the assessee had acquired some land which he had transferred as capital contribution to his partnership firm under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for construction of multi-storied residential apartment complex.It was observed that assessee before the transfer first revalued the land and transferred the land at revalued price to the firm. The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Disallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT Act with respect to by-product/exempt goods – Supreme Court allows ITCABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3813 (2023) (11) SCImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:State of Karnataka v. M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do.

    "data": "Excel Form 10E-Salary Arrears Relief calculator AY 2023-24 (FY 2022-23) for claiming rebate under section 89(1) of Income Tax Act 1961-DownloadAs per section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relief for income tax has been provided when in a financial year an employee receives salary in arrears or advance. As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Addition for bogus capital gain in penny stock company deleted as shares were purchased and sold before order of SEBI and investigation reportABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3814 (2023) (11) ITATImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:Karuna Garg and OthersIn the instant case, the assessee had challenged the order passed by the CIT(A) in confirming denial of exemption claimed u/s 10(38) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) in respect of long term capital gain earned on sale of listed equity sharesDuring the course of scrutiny assessment proceedings, the Assessing Officer noticed that the assessee had shown long term capital gain on sale of shares of a listed company which was claimed to be exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.From the report of the Directorate of Investigation, the Assessing Officer formed a belief that the impugned long term capital gains were result of transaction in penny stock.The Investigation Wing had elaborately discussed the modus operandi adopted by the operators, which was to make the beneficiary buy some shares of a pre-determined penny stock company controlled by them. These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Disallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT Act with respect to by-product/exempt goods – Supreme Court allows ITCABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3813 (2023) (11) SCImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:State of Karnataka v. M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Also the calculator is meant only for tangible assets. Like, in last year useful life of the assets purchased during the FY 2022-23 is taken in integers only.Any error or suggestions may please be reported at lohni@yahoo.comPlease note that while downloading this utility save it as either Excel 97-2003 (xls) or Macro Enabled sheet in Excel 2007 or later versions (.xlsm) Only The calculator has been divided into five part as under: (a) Assets (b) Opening Details (c) Additions (d) Opening Deletions, and (e) Depreciation Chart In each part only “grey” fields are required to be filled.Assets database should be created by providing names of the assets and by selecting the asset type as per schedule-II. Please note that no two names should be identical. If for example there are multiple computers, they should be written in different rows as computer1, computer2…and so on.Since, you must be having the individual asset-wise list of closing wdv as on 31/03/2021 or the depreciated value of the asset as on 31/03/2014 (for SLM purposes) creating this database should not be a problem.Please note that new assets purchased during FY 2022-23 should also be filled in this database. Again, please bear in mind that they should also be unique and not bear an identical name to an existing asset.For example:You have opening wdv of the block furniture individually for each asset (say, “furniture1”, “furniture2”, “furniture3”) and if during FY 2022-23 there is another addition to the block furniture, then a new nomenclature (say, “furniture4”) should be used in the asset sheet. In the “new addition sheet” this new furniture “Furniture4” is required to be selected for calculating depreciation on new additions.Since the users must be having individual asset wise closing wdv as on 31/03/2022, the details required in the opening sheet should be filled using the wdv list as on 31/03/2022.For SLM purposes, depreciated book value of the assets should be filled in column B.In the Opening WorkSheet, the following particulars are required to be given:Name of assets > fill the “Asset Sheet” as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22 and select by drop downDepreciated value of asset as on 01/04/2014 (if using SLM)WDV as on 01-04-2022 > as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22.

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do. Whether to continue existing payments towards insurance premium, provident fund etc. or whether defer their housing loan etc. The helpless individual taxpayers which do not have access to a tax expert are finding hard to determine which tax regime is beneficial to them.The ABCAUS Excel calculator compares tax incidence under the existing tax regime and the proposed New Simplified Personal Tax Regime and attempts to provide a handy tool to the taxpayers to choose their course of action in future.(Upldated on 26/06/2023)Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Excel Form 10E-Salary Arrears Relief calculator AY 2023-24 (FY 2022-23) for claiming rebate under section 89(1) of Income Tax Act 1961-DownloadAs per section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relief for income tax has been provided when in a financial year an employee receives salary in arrears or advance. As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Also the calculator is meant only for tangible assets. Like, in last year useful life of the assets purchased during the FY 2022-23 is taken in integers only.Any error or suggestions may please be reported at lohni@yahoo.comPlease note that while downloading this utility save it as either Excel 97-2003 (xls) or Macro Enabled sheet in Excel 2007 or later versions (.xlsm) Only The calculator has been divided into five part as under: (a) Assets (b) Opening Details (c) Additions (d) Opening Deletions, and (e) Depreciation Chart In each part only “grey” fields are required to be filled.Assets database should be created by providing names of the assets and by selecting the asset type as per schedule-II. Please note that no two names should be identical. If for example there are multiple computers, they should be written in different rows as computer1, computer2…and so on.Since, you must be having the individual asset-wise list of closing wdv as on 31/03/2021 or the depreciated value of the asset as on 31/03/2014 (for SLM purposes) creating this database should not be a problem.Please note that new assets purchased during FY 2022-23 should also be filled in this database. Again, please bear in mind that they should also be unique and not bear an identical name to an existing asset.For example:You have opening wdv of the block furniture individually for each asset (say, “furniture1”, “furniture2”, “furniture3”) and if during FY 2022-23 there is another addition to the block furniture, then a new nomenclature (say, “furniture4”) should be used in the asset sheet. In the “new addition sheet” this new furniture “Furniture4” is required to be selected for calculating depreciation on new additions.Since the users must be having individual asset wise closing wdv as on 31/03/2022, the details required in the opening sheet should be filled using the wdv list as on 31/03/2022.For SLM purposes, depreciated book value of the assets should be filled in column B.In the Opening WorkSheet, the following particulars are required to be given:Name of assets > fill the “Asset Sheet” as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22 and select by drop downDepreciated value of asset as on 01/04/2014 (if using SLM)WDV as on 01-04-2022 > as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22. If useful life of the asset was zero as on 01/04/2014 it would be equal to the residual value.Remaining useful life > as per useful life as on 01/04/2014 minus three yearsIf useful life zero as on 01/04/2014 > Select Yes or NoIf asset has been sold during FY 2022-23 > select Yes or No from drop downEstimated residual value > as estimated during FY 2014-15.

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do. Whether to continue existing payments towards insurance premium, provident fund etc. or whether defer their housing loan etc. The helpless individual taxpayers which do not have access to a tax expert are finding hard to determine which tax regime is beneficial to them.The ABCAUS Excel calculator compares tax incidence under the existing tax regime and the proposed New Simplified Personal Tax Regime and attempts to provide a handy tool to the taxpayers to choose their course of action in future.(Upldated on 26/06/2023)Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Excel Form 10E-Salary Arrears Relief calculator AY 2023-24 (FY 2022-23) for claiming rebate under section 89(1) of Income Tax Act 1961-DownloadAs per section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relief for income tax has been provided when in a financial year an employee receives salary in arrears or advance. As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel.

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do.

    "data": "Excel Form 10E-Salary Arrears Relief calculator AY 2023-24 (FY 2022-23) for claiming rebate under section 89(1) of Income Tax Act 1961-DownloadAs per section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relief for income tax has been provided when in a financial year an employee receives salary in arrears or advance. As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel.

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Nageswara Rao vs. Dy. CITIncome Tax Officer vs. Orchid Griha Nirman (P) Ltd reported in (2022) 134 Taxmann.com 281 (Cal.)CIT vs. Sundaram Iyengar & Sons (P) Limited (1975) 101 ITR 764 (SC)Keshavji Ravji & Co. vs. CIT (1990) 183 ITR 1 (SC)UOI vs. Kamlakshi Finance Corporation Ltd. 1992 taxmann.com 16 (SC)DLF Universal vs. DCIT (2010) 123 ITD 0001Sunil Siddharthbhai vs. CIT (1985) 156 ITR 509 (S.C)In the instant case, the assessee had challenged the order passed by the CIT(A) in confirming addition of capital gain u/s 45(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) on account of transfer of land as capital contribution in partnership firm.The Assessing Officer during the course of assessement proceedings noted that the assessee had acquired some land which he had transferred as capital contribution to his partnership firm under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for construction of multi-storied residential apartment complex.It was observed that assessee before the transfer first revalued the land and transferred the land at revalued price to the firm. The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Addition for bogus capital gain in penny stock company deleted as shares were purchased and sold before order of SEBI and investigation reportABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3814 (2023) (11) ITATImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:Karuna Garg and OthersIn the instant case, the assessee had challenged the order passed by the CIT(A) in confirming denial of exemption claimed u/s 10(38) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) in respect of long term capital gain earned on sale of listed equity sharesDuring the course of scrutiny assessment proceedings, the Assessing Officer noticed that the assessee had shown long term capital gain on sale of shares of a listed company which was claimed to be exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.From the report of the Directorate of Investigation, the Assessing Officer formed a belief that the impugned long term capital gains were result of transaction in penny stock.The Investigation Wing had elaborately discussed the modus operandi adopted by the operators, which was to make the beneficiary buy some shares of a pre-determined penny stock company controlled by them. These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do. Whether to continue existing payments towards insurance premium, provident fund etc. or whether defer their housing loan etc. The helpless individual taxpayers which do not have access to a tax expert are finding hard to determine which tax regime is beneficial to them.The ABCAUS Excel calculator compares tax incidence under the existing tax regime and the proposed New Simplified Personal Tax Regime and attempts to provide a handy tool to the taxpayers to choose their course of action in future.(Upldated on 26/06/2023)Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "ABCAUS Excel Depreciation Calculator FY 2022-23 under Companies Act 2013 as per Schedule-II Version 04.26The maiden ABCAUS Excel Companies Act 2013 Depreciation Calculator was first launched in March, 2015. The ABCAUS Depreciation calculator for FY 2022-23 has also been formulated and styled the same way as its predecessor so that users find themselves familiar with it.This calculator is meant for companies following April to March Financial year. Also the calculator is meant only for tangible assets. Like, in last year useful life of the assets purchased during the FY 2022-23 is taken in integers only.Any error or suggestions may please be reported at lohni@yahoo.comPlease note that while downloading this utility save it as either Excel 97-2003 (xls) or Macro Enabled sheet in Excel 2007 or later versions (.xlsm) Only The calculator has been divided into five part as under: (a) Assets (b) Opening Details (c) Additions (d) Opening Deletions, and (e) Depreciation Chart In each part only “grey” fields are required to be filled.Assets database should be created by providing names of the assets and by selecting the asset type as per schedule-II. Please note that no two names should be identical. If for example there are multiple computers, they should be written in different rows as computer1, computer2…and so on.Since, you must be having the individual asset-wise list of closing wdv as on 31/03/2021 or the depreciated value of the asset as on 31/03/2014 (for SLM purposes) creating this database should not be a problem.Please note that new assets purchased during FY 2022-23 should also be filled in this database. Again, please bear in mind that they should also be unique and not bear an identical name to an existing asset.For example:You have opening wdv of the block furniture individually for each asset (say, “furniture1”, “furniture2”, “furniture3”) and if during FY 2022-23 there is another addition to the block furniture, then a new nomenclature (say, “furniture4”) should be used in the asset sheet. In the “new addition sheet” this new furniture “Furniture4” is required to be selected for calculating depreciation on new additions.Since the users must be having individual asset wise closing wdv as on 31/03/2022, the details required in the opening sheet should be filled using the wdv list as on 31/03/2022.For SLM purposes, depreciated book value of the assets should be filled in column B.In the Opening WorkSheet, the following particulars are required to be given:Name of assets > fill the “Asset Sheet” as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22 and select by drop downDepreciated value of asset as on 01/04/2014 (if using SLM)WDV as on 01-04-2022 > as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22. If useful life of the asset was zero as on 01/04/2014 it would be equal to the residual value.Remaining useful life > as per useful life as on 01/04/2014 minus three yearsIf useful life zero as on 01/04/2014 > Select Yes or NoIf asset has been sold during FY 2022-23 > select Yes or No from drop downEstimated residual value > as estimated during FY 2014-15. By default it was taken 5%Depreciation Rate > The rate as calculated in FY 2014-15 should be filledRest of the values shall be calculated automaticallyDate of format should be dd/mm/yyyyNo field should be left blank.Date of format should be dd/mm/yyyyFor each new additions, first they should be created in ‘Assets” sheet.For new additions made during the year, residual value has been taken @ 5% by default.If any disposal has been made out of additions during the year, its details must be filled in columns ‘f” and “g” after selecting “Yes” in column “e”Please note that useful lives of assets can be altered from the sheet useful life.This sheet accounts for any deletion that has been made out of the opening assets, (i.e.; out of opening sheet)Only those assets which have been disposed off during FY 2022-23 should be selected under assets name list.If you have selected “yes” against any asset in column “f” in opening sheet, the same asset must be selected hereDate of format should be dd/mm/yyyyDate of purchase of disposed asset should be available as per depreciation chart prepared for FY 2014-15.This sheet must be filled after completing the ‘Opening sheet” Depreciation ChartIt should be automatically calculated.&lt;br /&gt;The calculator is meant to guide and help in calculating the depreciation, the disclosure requirements have to be separately taken care of.Also the WDV written off should be charged either to reserves and surplus or profit and loss account.

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do. Whether to continue existing payments towards insurance premium, provident fund etc. or whether defer their housing loan etc. The helpless individual taxpayers which do not have access to a tax expert are finding hard to determine which tax regime is beneficial to them.The ABCAUS Excel calculator compares tax incidence under the existing tax regime and the proposed New Simplified Personal Tax Regime and attempts to provide a handy tool to the taxpayers to choose their course of action in future.(Upldated on 26/06/2023)Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Excel Form 10E-Salary Arrears Relief calculator AY 2023-24 (FY 2022-23) for claiming rebate under section 89(1) of Income Tax Act 1961-DownloadAs per section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relief for income tax has been provided when in a financial year an employee receives salary in arrears or advance. As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Addition for bogus capital gain in penny stock company deleted as shares were purchased and sold before order of SEBI and investigation reportABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3814 (2023) (11) ITATImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:Karuna Garg and OthersIn the instant case, the assessee had challenged the order passed by the CIT(A) in confirming denial of exemption claimed u/s 10(38) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) in respect of long term capital gain earned on sale of listed equity sharesDuring the course of scrutiny assessment proceedings, the Assessing Officer noticed that the assessee had shown long term capital gain on sale of shares of a listed company which was claimed to be exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.From the report of the Directorate of Investigation, the Assessing Officer formed a belief that the impugned long term capital gains were result of transaction in penny stock.The Investigation Wing had elaborately discussed the modus operandi adopted by the operators, which was to make the beneficiary buy some shares of a pre-determined penny stock company controlled by them. These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel.

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges.

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Disallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT Act with respect to by-product/exempt goods – Supreme Court allows ITCABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3813 (2023) (11) SCImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:State of Karnataka v. M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Disallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT Act with respect to by-product/exempt goods – Supreme Court allows ITCABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3813 (2023) (11) SCImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:State of Karnataka v. M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Also the calculator is meant only for tangible assets. Like, in last year useful life of the assets purchased during the FY 2022-23 is taken in integers only.Any error or suggestions may please be reported at lohni@yahoo.comPlease note that while downloading this utility save it as either Excel 97-2003 (xls) or Macro Enabled sheet in Excel 2007 or later versions (.xlsm) Only The calculator has been divided into five part as under: (a) Assets (b) Opening Details (c) Additions (d) Opening Deletions, and (e) Depreciation Chart In each part only “grey” fields are required to be filled.Assets database should be created by providing names of the assets and by selecting the asset type as per schedule-II. Please note that no two names should be identical. If for example there are multiple computers, they should be written in different rows as computer1, computer2…and so on.Since, you must be having the individual asset-wise list of closing wdv as on 31/03/2021 or the depreciated value of the asset as on 31/03/2014 (for SLM purposes) creating this database should not be a problem.Please note that new assets purchased during FY 2022-23 should also be filled in this database. Again, please bear in mind that they should also be unique and not bear an identical name to an existing asset.For example:You have opening wdv of the block furniture individually for each asset (say, “furniture1”, “furniture2”, “furniture3”) and if during FY 2022-23 there is another addition to the block furniture, then a new nomenclature (say, “furniture4”) should be used in the asset sheet. In the “new addition sheet” this new furniture “Furniture4” is required to be selected for calculating depreciation on new additions.Since the users must be having individual asset wise closing wdv as on 31/03/2022, the details required in the opening sheet should be filled using the wdv list as on 31/03/2022.For SLM purposes, depreciated book value of the assets should be filled in column B.In the Opening WorkSheet, the following particulars are required to be given:Name of assets > fill the “Asset Sheet” as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22 and select by drop downDepreciated value of asset as on 01/04/2014 (if using SLM)WDV as on 01-04-2022 > as per closing wdv list of FY 2021-22.

Union Budget 2023-24 has disappointed individual taxpayers who were expecting tax benefits in the form of substantial increase in basic threshold of income tax exemption and increase in deductions particularly in Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Government instead of meeting out any of the expectations, kept the existing tax exemption limit and available deductions/rebates unchanged.However, for the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Simplified Personal Income Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:For the AY 2024-25, the basic exemption limit for New Tax Regime has been increased to Rs. 3 lakhs and number of tax slabs has bene reduced to five as under:The Finance Bill 2020 (26 of 2020) has inserted new sections namely section 115BAC to introduce the new Scheme of Taxation on income of Individuals and HUFs.The Budget 2023-24 proposes to make the New Tax Regime u/s 115BAC as the default one. However the taxpayers shall have an optional to choose old regime.Unlike the existing tax regime consisting of three taxable slabs with minimum tax rate of 5% and highest being 30%, the New Tax Regime consists of five taxable brackets with minimum tax rate of 5% with 5% incremental rise for each higher tax brackets except for fifth slab where incremental rise is 10%..A comparative chart of the tax brackets and rates under both Regime is as under:Going by the above table alone, its seems a perfect gift to the taxpayers where tax rates have been slashed and more tax brackets have been provided to reduce the tax burden. But this lucrative New Tax Regime comes with a condition that many taxpayers would not appreciate.Under the New Tax Regime, the assessee shall not be entitled to most of the exemptions and deductions that a common taxpayers has relied upon extensively not only to make investments but also to plan and reduce his tax. The notable deductions/exemptions that would be unavailable in the new Tax Regime include standard deduction on salaries, housing loan interest, section 80C deductions (for insurance premium, P.F., tuition fees, etc.) etc.The relief however is that the new Regime is only optional and is totally at the wisdom of the assessee whether to choose it or not.Taxpayers are in a fix what to do. Whether to continue existing payments towards insurance premium, provident fund etc. or whether defer their housing loan etc. The helpless individual taxpayers which do not have access to a tax expert are finding hard to determine which tax regime is beneficial to them.The ABCAUS Excel calculator compares tax incidence under the existing tax regime and the proposed New Simplified Personal Tax Regime and attempts to provide a handy tool to the taxpayers to choose their course of action in future.(Upldated on 26/06/2023)Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Excel Form 10E-Salary Arrears Relief calculator AY 2023-24 (FY 2022-23) for claiming rebate under section 89(1) of Income Tax Act 1961-DownloadAs per section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relief for income tax has been provided when in a financial year an employee receives salary in arrears or advance. As per Rule 21AA of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Form 10-E  has been prescribed for claiming the relief.According to the said rule, in case the employee is a Government servant or is an employee in a company, cooperative society, local authority, university, institution or association of body, he/she may for claiming the relief submit the form 10E to his/her employer who is responsible for making the payment of the salary as referred to in sub section (1) of section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961In all other cases, the assessee for claiming the relief should file an application in form 10E to his/her income tax assessing officer.   The relief under section 89(1) is allowable in the assessment year  in which the arrears or the advance is received by the employee.Pay revisions particularly in Government Sector has become common. Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.

    "data": "NFRA imposes penalty of Rs. 25 lakhs and debars CA for 7 years for professional misconduct in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services LtdABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3338 (2020) (07) NFRAThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA / Authority) helds CA guilty of professional misconduct for performance as Engagement Partner in statutory audit of ILFS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for the year 2017-18.The CA was charged with professional misconduct in terms of Sec 132(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the following clauses in Part I of the Second Schedule to the CAs Act as under:However, in terms of the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in pursuance of Writ Petition filed by the CA challenging the constitutional validity of Section 132(4) of the Companies Act 2013, the jurisdiction of NFRA, etc., the order passed by NFRA shall not be given effect till 31st July, 2020.In the instant case NFRA proceeded with the proceedings in pursuance of its show cause notice (SCN) as it had provided considerable time to the CA to file its replies and no stay was granted by the Hon’ble High Court.All the charges against the CA was primarily on account of violations of the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by ICAI and consequent violations of the Companies Act, 2013, and Code of Ethics.The NFRA inter alia extensively relied upon the SAs ( SA 200, SA 230, SA 240, SA 250, SA 260, SA 315, SA 570, SA 580 and SA 700 ) and stated that there is a clear set of positive duties that are cast upon the auditor by the SAs and which need to be complied with to claim that “due diligence” has been delivered.The CA had argued that the words “Gross Negligence” have not been defined in the Chartered Accountants Act. However, the NFRA noted that the commentary on Clause 7 of Part I of the Second Schedule published by ICAI states that negligence per se does not constitute gross negligence, and thus does not amount to professional misconduct. Any professional accountant would be liable for misconduct only if his actions amounts to culpable negligence, which would justify holding him guilty for gross negligence”.The NFRA opined that every auditor would, as a matter of prudence, should comply with the SAs. Failure to do so would certainly, therefore, amount to culpable negligence,One of the argument of the CA was that he had delegated the key tasks to his partner CA but no documents in the Audit File showed such a delegation and the nature and extent of duties delegated by the CA partner. None of the record showed that the CA charged was the engagement partner, though he had signed the Audit Report on behalf of the Audit Firm which according to the NFRA was in violation of SA 220 and SQC-1.NFRA held the charges of professional misconduct framed against the CA as proved.The decideing the amount of penalty, NFRA considered the following:It was clearly visible that the independence in mind and independence in appearance of the statutory auditor had been totally compromised. As Engagement Partner, it was the duty of CA charged to take necessary preventive action to ensure that his, and his Firm’s, independence was not affected. He had been Managing Partner and CEO of Deloitte India for several years. His position in the Audit Firm, his standing in the profession, and his long experience, required him to be especially conscious of, and sensitive to, anything that could detract from his, and his firm’s, independence. This background makes the violation of independence that has been proved even more serious than it would have been in the case of any other partner. This was a serious lapse in the discharge of his duty as CA.Given the position, stature, and experience of the CA in question, to insist that there could be more than one Engagement Partner for an engagement was to bypass the SAs entirely. This certainly was one of the main reasons for the disastrous failure in audit quality. The CA failed to do what was expected from him as the Engagement Partner. A critical, questioning attitude, an unwillingness to be satisfied by merely superficial explanations, not concluding on material matters without rigorous verification from more than one angle, diligent and methodical cross verification, proper planning and the meticulous execution of the audit plan etc are fundamental to audit quality. Not only should the Engagement Partner have exhibited these qualities in the required measure, he should also have ensured the same in the rest of the Engagement Team as well.As expert professionals, auditors are expected to judge the significance of the operations of the entity they audit for the larger financial and economic sectors and accordingly calibrate their approach and procedures. The misconduct of the type and scale that have now been proved would be severely damaging to Public and Investor Confidence. It is, therefore, essential that the penalty imposed has a suitable deterrent effect on other auditors and, at the same time, sends out a message to the Public and the Investor Community that such misconduct will not be allowed to escape lightlyThe CA was not unaware of the Requirements of the SAs. He should have reasonably foreseen that the likely or actual consequences of his actions or inaction would amount to non-compliance with the SAs. This makes the professional misconduct very serious.Professional misconduct becomes very serious when the CA has gone along with the Management of the company in agreeing to misstatements/omissions so as to commit a fraud on the users of the financial statements. In this case, it is seen clearly that the company had actually incurred losses in the year 2017-18. It was only through such unacceptable/impermissible stratagems as the imputation of a value of Rs 184 crores to the Put Option on the TTSL shares that the actual incurred loss was turned into a reported profit. Besides, the fact that the company had ceased to comply with the stipulated NOF/CRAR norms was deliberately misstated. The CA went along with this attempt at fraudulent presentation of the financial statements. Hence, this would necessitate the imposition of a severe penalty.Accordingly, the NFRA made the following order:A monetary penalty of Rs Twenty Five lakhsIn addition, the CA was debarred for a period of seven years from being appointed as an auditor or internal auditor or undertaking any audit in respect of financial statements or internal audit of the functions and activities of any company or bodyLand introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Nageswara Rao vs. Dy. CITIncome Tax Officer vs. Orchid Griha Nirman (P) Ltd reported in (2022) 134 Taxmann.com 281 (Cal.)CIT vs. Sundaram Iyengar & Sons (P) Limited (1975) 101 ITR 764 (SC)Keshavji Ravji & Co. vs. CIT (1990) 183 ITR 1 (SC)UOI vs. Kamlakshi Finance Corporation Ltd. 1992 taxmann.com 16 (SC)DLF Universal vs. DCIT (2010) 123 ITD 0001Sunil Siddharthbhai vs. CIT (1985) 156 ITR 509 (S.C)In the instant case, the assessee had challenged the order passed by the CIT(A) in confirming addition of capital gain u/s 45(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) on account of transfer of land as capital contribution in partnership firm.The Assessing Officer during the course of assessement proceedings noted that the assessee had acquired some land which he had transferred as capital contribution to his partnership firm under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for construction of multi-storied residential apartment complex.It was observed that assessee before the transfer first revalued the land and transferred the land at revalued price to the firm. The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

    "data": "Addition for bogus capital gain in penny stock company deleted as shares were purchased and sold before order of SEBI and investigation reportABCAUS Case Law Citation:ABCAUS 3814 (2023) (11) ITATImportant Case Laws relied upon by parties:Karuna Garg and OthersIn the instant case, the assessee had challenged the order passed by the CIT(A) in confirming denial of exemption claimed u/s 10(38) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) in respect of long term capital gain earned on sale of listed equity sharesDuring the course of scrutiny assessment proceedings, the Assessing Officer noticed that the assessee had shown long term capital gain on sale of shares of a listed company which was claimed to be exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.From the report of the Directorate of Investigation, the Assessing Officer formed a belief that the impugned long term capital gains were result of transaction in penny stock.The Investigation Wing had elaborately discussed the modus operandi adopted by the operators, which was to make the beneficiary buy some shares of a pre-determined penny stock company controlled by them. These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

The Assessing Officer referred to provisions of section 45(3) of the Act according to which any contribution by the partner of a firm by way of capital asset shall be chargeable to tax as his income of the previous year in which such transfer takes place and for the purpose of section 48 the amount recorded in the books of the firm shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration received as accruing as a result of such transfer.The AO therefore, after recording reasons reopened the assessment u/s 147 with the prior approval of the appropriate authority as per section 151(2) of the Act, and issued notice u/s 148 of the Act to the assessee.The AO noted that in the Balance Sheet of the assessee, it was shown as the investment in the partnership firm on the assets side and in the Balance sheet of the firm, the same was reflected as the capital contribution on the liabilities side at the same amount.The stand of the assessee was that it entered into the joint development agreement with firm and the land held by the assessee and others together was jointly developed and introduced as the stock-in-trade.However, the AO held that the assessee was liable to pay capital gain tax. He made addition of of difference of cost of acquisition of the land and revalued price as short – term capital gain in the hands of the assessee.The CIT(A) was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and upheld the addition of capital gain in the hands of the assessee.Before the Tribunal, the assessee contended that that there was no consideration derived in the hands of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the AO wrongly applied the decision of the jurisdictional High Court. It was submitted that in said case it was held that when the transfer of capital asset is complete, sale consideration has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessment even though the payment of consideration deferred till other A.Y and therefore, the said decision was on different set of facts. However, in the instant case there was neither any transfer of capital asset nor any sale consideration. Therefore, the said decision was not applicable.The assessee also relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in contending that when partner brings in his asset into partnership as capital contribution, neither any consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrues to him in commercial sense and, therefore, no capital gain is chargeable u/s 45 of the Act.Referring to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court it was submitted that the Hon’ble High Court in the said decision has held that the section 45(3) would be applicable only in respect of a capital asset and not to stock-in-trade.With respect to the reliance placed on Special Bench of ITAT by the CIT(A), it was submitted that in that case, after introduction of land on revaluation, the amount credited was withdrawn immediately by the partners whereas, in the case of the assessee there was no such withdrawal of any capital introduced by way of stock-in trade by the assessee in the firm.The Tribunal observed that the contention of the assessee was that there was no consideration derived in the case of the assessee for keeping the stock-in-trade of land into the joint venture and therefore, the decision of the jurisdictional High Court was not applicable to the facts of the case. It was also a submission that no consideration is received by the partner within the meaning of section 48 nor does any profit or gain accrue to him in commercial sense and therefore, no capital gain chargeable u/s 45 arises. Further, it was the submission that in the absence of decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue and when there are conflicting decisions, the decision which is favourable to the assessee should be adopted.The Tribunal observed that there no merit in the above arguments. A plain reading of the provisions of section 45(3) clearly shows that the amount recorded in the books of the firm should be deemed to be the full value of contribution received or accrued as a result of such transfer.Further, the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that though section 45(3) applies when a capital asset is introduced into a firm as capital contribution, it will also apply when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction is on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.With respect to the reliance placed by the assessee on the decision of the Hon’ble High Court was concerned, the Tribunal opined that the same was not applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case a land was transferred by the assessee and other partners to the firm at its cost as current asset. Later, the firm converted the said land into fixed assets and revalued it. The amount of revaluations were credited to the current account of partners in their profit sharing ratio. The Assessing Officer in the re-assessement order brought to tax the amount credited as income chargeable to tax u/s 45(3). Under these circumstances, the Tribunal after considering the facts of the case held that the provisions of section 45(3) are not applicable to the facts of the case which has been upheld by the Hon’ble High Court.The Tribunal pointed out that in the instant case, the valuation of land was done by the assessee himself as against the cost price and the same has not been revalued by the joint venture or the firm. The assessee in that case has transferred the land at cost to the firm and the firm has revalued the land in question and the amounts were transferred to the current account of the partners.Also, the Tribunal observed that the Special Bench of the Tribunal had held that the provisions of section 45(3) also applies when stock-in-trade is introduced into a firm because the transaction on the capital account and stock-in-trade does not retain its character as stock-in-trade at the point of time of introduction.Accordingly, the ITAT opined that there was no infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) confirming that there was a transfer resulting in capital gain for the year under consideration and thereby confirming the addition made by the AO.Finally, the appeal was dismissed.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

These shares were transferred to the beneficiary at a very nominal price, mostly offline through preferential allotment or offline purchase/sale to save STT. The beneficiary holds the share for one year and as soon as the holding becomes long term, shares are sold at a rigged high price, thereby generating long term capital gain, which is subsequently claimed as exempt u/s 10(38) of the Act.Based on the aforementioned observations, the Assessing Officer denied the claim of exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act and made further addition towards hypothetical commission paid for procuring long term capital gains.The Tribunal observed that undisputed fact was that shares were allotted to the assessee who has applied in the IPO of the company. On allotment, shares were credited in the demat account of the assessee and the payments have been made through regular banking channel. Purchase of shares was subject to security transaction tax.The Tribunal opined that the Assessing Officer has proceeded by heavily relying upon the report of the Investigation Wing regarding list of companies engaged in providing accommodation entries in the garb of bogus long term capital gains, modus operandi being penny stock trading through recognized stock exchanges. Though the assessee furnished all details but the same were rubbished by the Assessing Officer.The Tribunal further observed that the entire assessment had been framed by the Assessing Officer without conducting any enquiry from the relevant parties or independent evidence or source, but had merely relied upon the statement by the Investigation Wing.Also, the ITAT noted that report of the Investigation Wing was much after the date of transaction when the assessee had already sold scrip. It was true that the shares of the company involved were suspended from trading in stock exchange but the shares were purchased and sold by the assessee much before the report of the Investigation Wing and also the order of the SEBI.Further, the Tribunal observed that on identical set of facts the co-ordinate bench had considered the same shares and deleted the addition which was affirmed by the Hon’ble High Court.On finding parity of facts, following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench the Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to allow the exemption u/s 10(38) of the Act in respect of LTCGs and further direct the Assessing Officer to delete the hypothetical addition for commission.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

M.K. Agro Tech Private Limited, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 210The issue was related to Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 (UP VAT Act). The appeal was directed against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court taking a view that took the view that the appellant assessee was not entitled to the full benefit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed on the goods purchased by it for manufacturing its final product.The appellant assessee company was a registered dealer under the UP VAT Act and was engaged in the business of manufacture. The goods produced fall within the ambit of “taxable goods” under the UP VAT Act. In the manufacturing process a by-product was also produced which fall within the category of exempted goods under the UP VAT Act.The matter travelled to Hon’ble High Court. The High Court took the view that a dealer has no vested right to seek the benefit of ITC as the same is just a concession by virtue of the provisions of the Act. The High Court relying on Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act took the view that the assessee is not entitled to claim full ITC on the inputs.Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the assessee contended that the order of the High Court was based on incorrect application of the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statutory provisions under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 and UP VAT Act are distinct and different in all respects.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (the 2010 Amendment), indicate that the legislative intent was never to limit or circumscribe the scope of “goods” as outlined in Section 13(1)(f) to only “taxable goods”.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that had the legislative intent of the 2010 Amendment been to limit the scope and ambit of “goods” under Section 13(1)(f) solely to “taxable goods”, there was nothing that could have prevented the Legislature from expressly using the phrase “taxable goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act.Also, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that Rule 23(6) of the Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2006 (UP VAT Rules”) (which provides for the computation of reverse ITC in cases of a dealer other than a trader), wherein the word “goods” has not been qualified by “taxable” and rather has used the word “any” to expressly convey the unequivocal legislative mandate.Further, it was observed that “taxable goods” has been separately defined under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act.The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that Section 13(3)(b) of the UP VAT Act, introduces the concept of proportionality in the scheme of the enactment and by means of a deeming fiction provides that where during the manufacture of VAT goods, exempt and non-VAT goods (except as by-product or waste product) are produced, the amount of ITC credit may be claimed and may be allowed in proportion to the extent they are used or consumed in manufacture of taxable goods other than the non-VAT goods and exempt goods. Further, in Explanation (iii) to Section 13 it is provided that during the manufacture of any taxable goods, any exempt goods are produced as by-product or waste product, it shall be deemed that the purchased goods have been used in the manufacture of taxable goods.The Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that reliance placed by the VAT Department is not applicable to the case on hand as the provisions under the Karnataka VAT Act are quite different compared to that of the UP VAT Act in regard to the scheme of ITC. Section 11(a)(1) of the Karanataka VAT Act as above specifically stipulates that where a sale of exempt goods takes place i.e., there is no output tax received on such sale, the input tax paid for manufacturing/processing such exempt goods cannot be credited while calculating the net tax. It is beyond any pale of doubt that the UP VAT Act does not provide for any such scheme or provision that aims at achieving the same.The Hon’ble Supreme Court opined that the scheme under the UP VAT Act is not the same as in Karnataka and no provision regarding calculation of the apportionment etc., has been provided for under the UP VAT Act. The reliance by the High Court therefore on this decision is not correct. It is not applicable to the facts of the present case, and could not have been relied upon to deny the full ITC to the assessee.The Hon’ble Supreme Court illustrated with calculation of ITC with respect to case in hand under both Karnataka VAT Act 2003 and UP Vat Act 2008.As a result, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad was set aside and the orders passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal was restored.Land introduced as capital in partnership firm rightly taxed as capital gain u/s 45(3) – ITATAddition for bogus capital gain deleted as transaction took place before SEBI orderCAG to consider Branch Offices of CA firms based on percent/number of partners stationed thereDisallowance of ITC under UP VAT Act 2008 not same as in Karnataka VAT – Supreme CourtNational Savings Recurring Deposit (3rd Amendment) Scheme 2023"

Since independence six Pay Commissions have been set up by the Government so far. Recommendations of each commission with retrospective effect have resulted in arrears of salaries. The rationale behind giving this relief under section 89 is that due to the payment of arrear or advance salary received in a given financial   year , the income of the employee for that financial year gets increased due to the amount of the arrears or advances. As a result, the income of the employee attracts taxation at a higher rate than that rate at which his income would have been taxed had there been no such arrears or advances.  The steps involved in computing the relief under section 89(1) basically involves the following steps:First- spread out the amount of arrears or advance received over the specific financial year to which they relate and re-calculate the income tax for each year had the arrears been received during the concerned financial year itself.Second-calculate income tax for each of the financial years without taking into account the arrears or the advance received.Third- deduct the total of income tax arrived at 2nd step from step-1.Fourth-calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, including the arrears/advance received.Fifth- calculate income tax for the Financial year in which the arrears is received, excluding the arrears/advance received.Sixth- deduct income tax arrived at step-5 from  income tax arrived at step-4Seventh- deduct income tax arrived at step-3 from income tax arrived at step-6The figure so arrived is the amount of the relief under section 89(1)Please note that this excel utility is for helping you to compute the relief and the details thereof are required to be filled online electronicaly.The steps for filing online form No. 10E are as under:1.
