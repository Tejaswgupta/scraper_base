        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Intraday trading relates to purchasing and selling stocks within the same trading day before the stock market closes. Stocks are purchased with the motive of earning profits in a short term. Investments is not the objective. This is undertaken by capitalising on the movement of stock indices. The varied prices of the stocks are harnessed in order to earn profits from the trading of stocks.\nAn online trading account is required to be set up with relevant orders, which are explicit to intraday trading. In case a trader fails to close their position within the day, it will be automatically squared off by their stockbroker at the closing time. Intraday trades are purely driven by profits. \nOn the other hand, unlike intraday trading, delivery trading involves no time constraints in the selling of stocks. In delivery trading, shares bought can be maintained for a longer duration to rake in higher profit returns. The stocks a trader buys are added to the demat (dematerialised) account. The stocks remain in the possession of the trader until they decide to sell them. A trader enjoys complete ownership of the stocks. A delivery trade cannot be performed without a demat account.\nIntraday trading involves judging and forecasting the value of shares at short and small intervals. There are technical tools available that can be deployed in predicting short-term price movements.\nDelivery trading involves long-term investing, a trader needs to pick shares based on a company’s intrinsic value and relatable assessments, which are a particular company’s fundamental indicators such as price-to-earnings ratio and book value, among others.\nRajiv is an independent editorial consultant for the last decade.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "1. Hi. I am a dealer supplying goods with a registered office in Bangalore. ABC Ltd., based in Karnataka, recently made a purchase for Rs.1 lakh and instructed me to ship it to a warehouse in Tamil Nadu. Will I need to raise an invoice charging CGST/SGST or charging IGST?\nAnswer: This will be a ‘bill to ship to’ transaction case. ‘Bill to ship to’ transactions involve three parties – the supplier, the recipient and the third person. The goods are shipped to the recipient by the supplier on the instructions of a third person. The first part of the transaction will be between the supplier and the third person. The next will be between the third person and the recipient. GST is charged to both recipients depending on their places of business. \nIn this situation, you are the supplier, the warehouse in Tamil Nadu is the recipient, and ABC Ltd. is the third person. The first invoice raised by you to ABC Ltd. will need to have state tax (SGST) and central tax (CGST) charged as it is an intra-state supply. The second invoice raised by ABC Ltd. to the company based in Tamil Nadu will have integrated GST (IGST) charged as it is an interstate transaction.\n2. Hello. I purchased a house property under construction a couple of years ago, but the project was never completed. The builder has agreed to refund the amount paid to me, excluding the GST portion, as the same has already been paid to the government. Is there a way for me to claim this GST paid? \nAnswer: The CBIC recently released a circular detailing the process where a GST refund can be claimed by unregistered persons under two scenarios. One of them includes cases where a construction contract has been cancelled for reasons such as non-completion or delay. In such cases, the buyer may receive a refund from the builder without GST as the same would have already been paid to the government, and the time limit for issuing a credit note would have also expired.\nIn this case, you can file a refund application on the common GST portal by obtaining a temporary GST registration. You will need to select the same state/Union Territory as the supplier in respect of whose invoices you are filing the refund application. After you log in, go to Services -> Refunds -> Application for Refund. Under refund type, select ‘Refund for Unregistered Taxpayer’. Proceed to fill in the necessary details and upload the relevant documents.\nPlease note that you will also need to complete the mandatory Aadhaar authentication and provide the bank account details that are in your name and obtained using your PAN.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "headline": "Taxes in 2023: A List of Expectations From Budget 2023",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "With every January comes new hopes and expectations, amongst them being a Union Budget wishlist for businesspersons, salaried individuals, and finance experts alike. Of course, the long-standing goals are always lower tax rates, tax savings, and ease of compliance. This year, too, is no different. Let’s take a look at the biggest expectations surrounding direct and indirect taxes in 2023.\nExpectations of the common man\nThe basic exemption limit has not changed for close to ten years now. The government instead gradually increased the amount of rebate a taxpayer can claim on incomes earned below Rs.5 lakh per annum. A new tax regime was also introduced but did not find favour amongst most taxpayers due to the complicated structure and lack of deductions. \nThis year, what taxpayers really hope to see is an increase in the basic exemption limit to Rs.5 lakh to relieve taxpayers earning an income up to this extent from having to file their returns and claim a rebate. The 80C deduction limit has also been stagnant for nearly a decade, and taxpayers and experts are hoping to see the Rs.1.5 limit raised to at least Rs.2.5 lakh this year. On the health insurance front, having separate deductions for premiums paid and medical expenses would be a welcome measure. \nAnother major change taxpayers wish to see is an increase in the Public Provident Fund or PPF limit. At present, individuals can invest up to Rs.1.5 lakh every financial year, and there has been no change in the limit of this popular investment option for years. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has recently recommended in the pre-Budget memorandum that this limit be upped to Rs.3 lakh. This move would be particularly advantageous to non-salaried taxpayers who do not have the option of investing via the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), coupled with an equal contribution from the respective employer.\nThe ICAI has also asked for a separate deduction to be allowed for payments relating to other insurance premiums paid, such as home insurance, travel insurance, personal accident insurance, etc., in a bid to push taxpayers to invest in security.\nWhen it comes to House Rent Allowance (HRA), taxpayers enjoy an income tax deduction based on a set of rules that vary depending on whether the taxpayer is from a metro or non-metro city. However, the metro cities in question were only limited to New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. Now, experts opine that the ‘50% of basic salary + dearness allowance’ rule should also be extended to other major metro cities such as Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Gurgaon, and Hyderabad, amongst others, given the skyrocketing rents in these cities.\nLikewise, an increase in the rent limit under Section 80GG to Rs.10,000 should also be considered, given that rents in most cities in India are now several times the current limit of Rs.5,000. \nMoving from rent to the purchase of a home, the financial year ended 2022 was to be the last year for taxpayers to claim a deduction under Section 80EEA, i.e. an additional Rs.1.5 lakh deduction for first-time home buyers. Taxpayers are expecting at least a two-year extension for this deduction. \nSimilarly, given the booming electric vehicle (EV) industry and the need for sustainable green energy vehicles, taxpayers hope that the deduction under Section 80EEB of Rs.1.5 lakh will also be given a two-year extension.\nFinally, to round up the list of major personal tax expectations from Budget 2023 are the requests by senior citizens to make pension earned exempt under the Income Tax Law, given that it’s the only source of income and security for many senior citizens. It is also expected that Budget 2023 will put senior and super senior citizens on a similar footing by increasing the tax exemption slab for senior citizens to Rs.5 lakh as well.\nSimplification of the capital gains tax structure\nCapital gains tax in India is currently very complicated, with different holding periods mentioned for different classes of assets to identify whether the capital gains earned are long-term or short-term and whether indexation benefits are available. Once identified, there are different tax rates and surcharges applicable to these gains. With this Budget, investors are hoping for a simpler capital gains tax system, which should reduce litigation and disputes arising on the matter.\nUniformity in the corporate tax rate\nCurrently, different sectors in India are taxed at different income tax rates. To position India as a competitive hub for both manufacturing and services industries, companies are advocating for the introduction of a uniform corporate tax rate of 15%. This would not only bolster the manufacturing sector but also allow the service sector to thrive. \nThat said, concessional tax regimes are offered for both companies and individuals. However, partnership firms and LLPs are still taxable at a flat rate of 30%. Hence, the government could consider introducing a similar concessional rate for them.\nClarity on cryptocurrency laws\nIn addition to modifying the tax slabs and rate structure, individuals and businesses alike are hoping to gain clarity in this Budget on cryptocurrency laws in India. While the government introduced taxes on digital assets for the first time last year, there is an absence of regulatory guidelines in the industry. The implementation of structured laws surrounding the trade of digital assets will protect investors and prevent any illegal dealings from taking place.\nThe main aim of the government in this Budget should be to widen the taxpayer base rather than impose stringent rules and surcharges on existing taxpayers. India has a very low taxpayer base, and the government should make optimum use of technology in order to change this. Potential taxpayers must be encouraged to file their tax returns, a move that will take slightly more effort in light of the recent pandemic and rising inflation. Measures such as simplification of the existing tax structure, the merging of surcharges into the tax rate, or the introduction of a flat tax rate might help to widen the taxpayer net.\nAn overhaul of the indirect tax system?\nIt’s been over five years since GST was implemented in India, and every year since then, GST taxpayers have been hit by a series of unending amendments to the GST law. Some of the biggest reforms in GST have been by way of introducing stringent restrictions on input tax credit (ITC) claims and by introducing the e-invoicing system. \nGiven how well both the GST and e-invoicing law has been working for both businesses in India and the government, it is unlikely that Budget 2023 will see an overhaul of the indirect tax law or even any major reforms. Though there has been pressure to merge the 12% and 18% tax slabs in order to decrease the total number of slabs under GST, it is unlikely that Budget 2023 will see this move happen.\nInstead, what businesses can expect to see in Budget 2023 with regard to indirect taxes are amendments to the GST Act based on recent recommendations by the GST Council in the Council meetings, especially around matters surrounding the decriminalisation of offences under the GST law. \nBesides certain tweaks to the GST law, there could be rate rationalisation to correct matters such as the inverted duty structure on certain goods and services. \nThere have also been certain industry expectations on the GST front, such as a uniform GST rate levy of 12% on all hotel rooms, as well as a full set-off of input tax credit. The EV industry has asked for a 5% GST to be levied on lithium-ion batteries as against the existing rate of 18% in a bid to increase demand for electric vehicles through lower tax rates and hence lower prices. The healthcare sector, too, is expecting to see a decrease in the GST rate on medical insurance premiums from 18% to 5%, given the pressing need for insurance in a post-pandemic world.\nThere have also been several long, drawn-out disputes and litigations under the Customs law. This Budget, it would be a worthwhile move for the government to launch a one-time amnesty scheme for customs to settle these prolonged disputes.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Next month, the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) will develop a revised incentive structure for the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for IT hardware to scale up domestic production and make it attractive for global players to relocate units from China.\nThe idea is to offer higher incentives and engage in fresh consultations with the industry so that a few prominent players who have not participated in the scheme can develop their India manufacturing plans.\nThe Success of PLI Scheme for Hardware\nGlobal players like HP and Dell, which already had some production units in India, have sent applications for the PLI IT hardware scheme since its announcement in February 2021. However, this scheme has not been as successful as the smartphone PLI scheme.\nFor instance, the smartphone’s quarterly production under PLI averages Rs.67,200 crore against the quarterly estimate of Rs.43,000 crore and attracted an investment of Rs.2,600 crore. But the IT hardware’s quarterly average production is at Rs.500 crore against the estimated Rs.750 crore and attracted investments of Rs.16,500 crore.\nProblems With the PLI Scheme for Hardware\nThere were problems from the start with the IT hardware scheme. When the government announced this scheme on 24 February 2021, the outlay was fixed at Rs.7,350 crore over four years. The government estimated production of up to Rs.3.26 lakh crore, out of which exports were expected to be of the order of Rs.2.45 lakh crore.\nOn 4 May 2021, the government announced the names of the companies that applied for the scheme, and it slashed the production target to Rs.1.60 lakh crore, of which exports would be Rs.60,000 crore.\nSince the incentive structure is based on attaining a minimum threshold of incremental sales over the base year increasing to a maximum limit, the outlay of Rs.7,350 crore for the scheme was cut back by half as companies committed to a lower production target.\nThe IT hardware manufacturers blamed the low production target on the incentive structure. The incentive works out to an average of 2-2.5% over four years, which does not justify relocating units from China or Vietnam, especially for hardware products where the import duties are nil as they fall under IT products.\nThe industry executives feel that the ideal incentive structure for IT hardware should be in the range of 7-8%. For companies like HP and Dell, who have participated in the IT hardware PLI scheme, the domestic sales are more attractive than the exports, which is the main driving force for the government behind redesigning the PLI scheme.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at mayashree.acharya@cleartax.in\nI am an Advocate by profession.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The GST Council may increase the 5% GST slab to 8% in its next council meeting, according to a report by the PTI news agency. At present, the GST slabs stand at 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, apart from exempted, nil-rated, and high-valued goods like jewellery and precious stones. A report has said that the lowest tax slab of 5% will likely be raised to 8% in a bid to increase the annual GST revenues. \nA panel of state finance ministers will submit its report by the end of the month to the Council, which will comprise various steps to boost revenues. One of the measures includes hiking the lowest slab of 5% and rationalising the slab. According to the agency, the increase in the lowest slab will result in additional annual revenue of Rs.1.5 lakh crore.\nThe Group of Ministers (GoM), headed by Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, is also looking at creating a three-tiered rate structure under GST consisting of 8%, 18% and 28% slabs. This means that they could also merge the 12% and 18% slabs. If this proposal were accepted, all goods currently in the 12% slab would move to the 18% slab. The GoM is also considering reducing the number of exemptions under GST and bringing the same under the various tax slabs.\n1st July 2022 will mark five years since the implementation of GST. The Centre imposed a compensation cess on luxury and sin goods over five years at the time of implementation. This was to protect the states’ revenue of 14% per annum over the base year revenue of 2015-16. \nWith the compensation regime coming to an end, the states will need to become self-sufficient. However, the 15.3% revenue-neutral rate estimated at the time of implementation of GST has come down to 11.6% over the past five years. This could be due to the reduction of GST on several goods. For example, 228 goods were attracting a GST rate of 28% when introducing GST. This number has come down to less than 35. Hence, according to a source, the only way to maintain revenue neutrality is by rationalising the tax slabs.\nSources have said that the GST Council is expected to meet either later this month or early next month to discuss the GoM report and to take a view on the revenue position of the states.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, don’t hesitate to contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in.\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "data": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor, Shaktikanta Das, focused on keeping rates low to support growth while stating that inflation, which has already breached the bank’s target range, will ease later this year.\nThe only dissenter amongst India’s monetary policy settlers is of the view that the RBI’s inflation-targeting credibility is at risk by focusing on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and maintaining loose policy for too long.\nExtracts of Interview with RBI Monetary Policy Member\nJayanth Rama Varma, a member of the RBI’s committee that decides on the key policy rates, stated in an interview this week that keeping an accommodative stance for too long will risk high-interest rates in future. He also noted that the RBI might have to do more later than it would have to do if it had acted early to maintain its credibility.\nIn August, Varma began voting against the MPC’s stance after expressing opposition to language about staying accommodative as long as necessary for supporting growth and mitigating the hit of COVID-19 while ensuring inflation remains within target.\nVarma’s Take on COVID-19 and Reverse Repo\nJayanth Rama Varma, a finance professor at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) at Ahmedabad, stated that it is time to ditch the COVID stuff from the monetary policy. He further noted that the trouble in the economy had got nothing to do with the pandemic. \nAn accommodative monetary policy means there is a risk of only low growth and low inflation, which Varma thinks is not true anymore. He fears that we are risking falling behind the curve. He feels that the circumstances tomorrow might need a change in the policy rate, but the RBI has more or less stated they will not change the rate.\nVerma stated that the RBI must maintain its freedom of action in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the looming risks to the global economy. He feels that there is no certainty of what will hit the economy and from where. Therefore, he expressed discomfort about the RBI’s commitment to what it will do in the future.\nOn the take on RBI keeping its reverse repo rate unchanged at 3.35%, used to drain excess funds from leaders, while holding variable reverse repo rate auctions at 3.99%, Varma stated there was a disconnect between the RBI’s words and actions.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at mayashree.acharya@cleartax.in.\nI am an Advocate by profession.

        "data": "The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has chosen E&Y Actuarial Services LLP for designing a new scheme under the New Pension Scheme (NPS). The sector regulator is probably going to permit minimum assured-return products in August.\nThe Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) had condemned PFRDA for not introducing products that comply with the PFRDA Act. Previously, the PFRDA chairman mentioned that such schemes in mutual funds and insurance had not performed well.\nGuaranteed products within the insurance industry were discontinued as providing a guarantee for a long duration may not be in the best interests of an organisation. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) also does not motivate any guaranteed product. As soon as a guarantee was provided, capital adequacy needs concerning fund managers went up.\nThe moment a guarantee is rendered, the markets decline; thus, fund managers will need to bring in more capital. Hence, actuarial inputs are needed. There will be different charge structures, not just capital needs, and there should be a separate guarantee fee. An ideal guarantee fee needs to be determined.\nIn comparison to other schemes, NPS has earned higher returns. For example, central government employees have earned returns ranging between 9.68% and 9.93% since its inception. State government employees have earned returns of 9.61% to -9.69%. These returns are higher in comparison to 8.5% returns earned via the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) for 2020-21.

        "data": "The Finance Minister presented the Budget 2022 speech today. There were no changes in the individual taxpayer’s tax slab rates, but the finance minister provided new taxation rules for the income generated from virtual digital assets. Let’s look at the key amendments in the Finance Bill 2022 for the taxpayers.\nNew Provision for Updation of ITR\nA new provision is inserted that allows the taxpayers to file an updated return for errors or mistakes done in income tax returns. Taxpayers can now file an updated return within two years from the end of the relevant assessment year. It is said to be a positive step towards promoting voluntary compliance.\nVirtual Digital Assets Taxation Scheme\nDue to the increase in the frequency and volume of transactions of Virtual Digital Assets, for the first time, the provision for taxation of virtual digital assets is introduced in Budget 2022. It has inserted Section 115 BBH, which provides taxation rules on income from virtual digital assets. The said provision states that any income from the transfer of virtual digital assets shall be taxed at 30%. No deduction for any expenditure shall be allowed from the same, except the acquisition cost. It further specifies that loss arising from the transfer of virtual digital assets cannot be adjusted against any other income, and it cannot be carried forward to subsequent years.\nAnother provision (Section 194S) is also inserted to deduct TDS at 1% at the time of payment on transfer of virtual digital assets where the amount is above the specified threshold limit.\nThe Finance Minister has further proposed to fully tax the gifts received in the form of virtual digital assets in the hands of the recipient. \nReduced AMT and Surcharge Rates for Co-operative Societies\nThe budget 2022 has reduced the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) to 15% of the adjusted total income from the current rate of 18.5% to provide parity in tax rates between co-operative societies and companies. It has further capped the surcharge at 7% for the co-operative societies with total income above Rs 1 crore and up to Rs 10 crore. \nNPS deduction to State government employees \nThe State government employees will now be able to claim deduction under Section 80CCD(2) for NPS contribution by the employer up to 14% of their basic salary and dearness allowance, which is in line with the deduction available to the Central government employees under the said section.\nTax Relief to the Persons with Disability\nCurrently, Section 80DD provides a tax deduction to the parents or guardians of the disabled person who have paid any amount under the insurance scheme specified in the said section. The said deduction is available only if such insurance scheme provides for the payment of annuity and lump sum amount to the differently-abled person on the death of the subscriber. The said section is amended to include insurance schemes that allow the payment of annuity and lump sum amount to the differently-abled dependant during the lifetime of the parent and guardians on attaining their age of sixty years or more, and the payment or deposit to such scheme has been discontinued. \nStart-ups Tax Incentive Period Extended \nCiting the start-ups as drivers for the economy’s growth, the benefit of tax incentives under Section 80-IAC was available to the start-ups that were incorporated up to 31st March 2022. However, the benefit of tax incentives is further extended to start-ups incorporated up to 31st March 2023. \nClarification for Allowability of Surcharge and Cess\nIt is further clarified that the surcharge and cess on income and profits will not be allowed as business expenditure.\nKey Changes in GST\nAmendments in Customs \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at namita.shah@cleartax.in.\nI’m a chartered accountant and a functional CA writer by profession.  Reading and travelling in free time enhances my creativity in work.

The department specified the cut-off dates for processing cases to ensure faster resolution of grievances of employees and its time-bound disposal.\nThe department’s latest note mentioned that the cut-off dates should not be taken as a reason not to process the option given by the employee within the due time. Therefore, it requested all ministries and departments to take the necessary action upon the exercise of options by the employees within a stipulated time.\nRequest for One-Time Pension\nAfter introducing the NPS, it mandatorily covers all Central Government employees appointed to the posts in the Central Government service (except armed forces) after 01.01.2004. The Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 and other related rules were also amended and made inapplicable to the Central Government employees appointed to the government services after 31.12.2003.\nHowever, the government received representations from the Central Government employees appointed after 1.1.2004 requesting to get the pension scheme’s benefit under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 on the ground of delay in their appointment due to administrative lapses or reasons.\nThus, the department of pension and pensioners’ welfare issued an office memorandum to provide a one-time pension option under the OPS in place of the NPS to the Central Government employees declared successful for retirement in the results declared before 31.12.2003.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at mayashree.acharya@cleartax.in\nI am an Advocate by profession.

        "data": "Are you looking to invest in future market leaders? Do you seek to diversify your portfolio beyond the top 50 stocks by market capitalisation in India? You may consider investing in Nifty Next 50 Index Funds. It is an index fund that tracks and replicates the Nifty Next 50 stock market index portfolio. Asset Management Companies or AMCs have launched Nifty Next 50 Index funds to help you diversify your portfolio beyond the top 50 stocks in India. Should you invest in Nifty Next 50 Index Funds? \nWhat are Nifty Next 50 Index Funds?\nNifty Next 50 Index Funds mirror the performance of the Nifty Next 50 index. It is a stock market index representing 50 companies from the Nifty 100 after keeping out the Nifty 50 companies. \nIn simple terms, these are companies from 51-100 in terms of market capitalisation in India. Moreover, the Nifty Next 50 Index is rebalanced semiannually for exposure to new businesses within the broader sector. \nShould you invest in Nifty Next 50 Index Funds?\nYou may consider investing in Nifty Next 50 Index Funds if you seek exposure to future market leaders. It focuses on large-cap companies, which may soon become a part of the major stock market indices such as the Nifty 50. Moreover, you get stocks of these companies at a better valuation as they have yet to attain status as market leaders.\nAccording to data, 75 stocks have graduated to become part of the Nifty 50 over 19 years. However, 51 of these stocks, which are now part of the Nifty 50, have graduated from the Nifty Next 50 index. \nMany investors consider Nifty 50 index funds as they track the top 50 stocks by market capitalisation in India. However, the Nifty 50 has a high weightage of around 36% towards financial services. It makes it vulnerable to nonperformance in this sector for some time.\nThe Nifty Next 50 is well diversified across metals, consumer goods and pharmaceuticals even though it has a weightage of around 19% towards financial services. For instance, the Nifty 50 index fund will perform well in a narrow or polarised market where only some sectors do well. However, the Nifty Next 50 Index Funds will do well when broader markets perform. \nYou can invest in the Nifty Next 50 Index Funds to attain your financial goals only if it matches your risk tolerance. Otherwise, you may stick with Nifty 50 Index funds less volatile than Nifty Next 50 Index Funds. \nHow has the Nifty Next 50 Index Performed?\nThe Nifty Next 50 Index has outperformed the Nifty 50 over ten years. However, the Nifty 50 has outperformed the Nifty Next 50 over a three and five-year timeframe. \nThe Nifty Next 50 is more volatile as compared to the Nifty 50. However, studies have shown the Nifty Next 50 to be more resilient than the Nifty 50 in bear markets. One of the reasons for this could be the focus of the Nifty Next 50 on defensive sectors such as FMCG and pharmaceuticals. \nThese sectors are a safe bet in a bear market. However, the Nifty 50 focuses on cyclical stocks such as financial services, which perform well during an economic rebound. \nThe Nifty Next 50 focuses on emerging sectors and businesses of the future. It presents an excellent opportunity to diversify your portfolio beyond the traditional sectors. In a nutshell, it helps if you diversify your portfolio in Nifty 50 and Nifty Next 50 Index Funds depending on your risk profile. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at cleyon.dsouza@cleartax.in\nI write to make complicated financial topics, simple.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The due date to file ITR for the F.Y. 2020-21 for individuals not covered under audit ended on 31st December 2021. \n Individuals who missed filing their return by this due date can still file the returns provided they will be levied a late filing penalty. Individuals filing Income Tax Return (ITR) after the due date with net taxable income exceeding Rs.5 lakh will have to pay a penalty of Rs. 5,000. Whereas the penalty is Rs 1,000 for those having taxable income below Rs.5 lakh. \nHowever, some individuals can file their ITR without any late fees even after the due date is passed. Let’s see who they are?\nAccording to the Income Tax Act, individuals with total gross income below the basic exemption limit do not have to pay a late fee penalty if they file their return after the due date. \nThe basic exemption threshold is different for the different age groups of taxpayers. Also, the tax rate applied depends on the tax regime chosen by the taxpayer while filing their return. Under the new tax regime, the basic exemption threshold is Rs.2.5 lakh for all age groups; however, no common deductions and exemptions are allowed.  \nIn the old income tax regime, the basic exemption limit depends on age. Under the old regime, the basic exemption limit for residents under 60 years was Rs 2.5 lakh, Rs.3 lakh between 60 to 80 years of age and Rs.5 lakh for individuals above 80 years. \nAdditionally, there are some conditions under which the individuals are mandatorily required to file ITR even if their taxable income is below the basic exemption limit:\nAccording to the seventh proviso of Section 139(1), individuals must file ITR even if their income is below this basic exemption limit if these conditions are met:\nTo simplify, you must file the return before the due date without a penalty if you own any foreign asset. In such a case, if you file your ITR after the due date, then even if your income is below the basic exemption limit, you will be levied a late filing penalty. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at jyoti.arora@cleartax.in\nI am a Chartered Accountant by profession with  4+ years of experience in the finance domain.

        "headline": "Mandatory Disclosures in ITR Filing",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The extended income tax return filing due date for FY 2020-21 is near, i.e. 31st of December 2021, and it is not advisable to wait till the last minute to file the return. \nThis article will discuss some mandatory disclosures required while filing the return. Let us see them one by one. \nSelection of correct tax regime\nFinance Act 2020 introduced a new tax regime under Section 115BAC. If taxpayers choose to file ITR (income tax return) according to the new tax regime, they must forgo significant deductions and exemptions allowed under the existing or old tax regime.\nThe taxpayers have to select between the regimes in the ITR by choosing yes/no to the question ‘opting for new tax regime u/s 115BAC?’. A taxpayer should select ‘yes’ if they want to file taxes according to the new tax regime and ‘no’ if they want to use all deductions and exemptions allowed under the old tax regime. A taxpayer should be vigilant in this selection as this selection affects the tax calculations. \nBank account disclosure:\nThe ITR filing portal now requires the disclosure of all bank accounts held by the taxpayer. \nA taxpayer has to mention the details of all types of accounts like current account, savings account (single and jointly held), all foreign accounts, Non-Resident External (NRE) and Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO) accounts, accounts held with co-operative banks, etc. However, dormant account details need not be mentioned. To add these accounts, information like the account number, bank name, IFSC code will be required. \nAlso, taxpayers will have to choose one of these accounts for a tax refund. For this, make sure that the account details are prevalidated for smooth processing of income tax refund. \nUnlisted stocks disclosure \nIf you are holding unlisted shares of any company registered under the Companies Act, 2013, then the details of these shares are to be reported in your ITR filing. The taxpayer’s disclosure of unlisted shares must be made under the ‘Part A- General’ information tab in ITR.  This disclosure is required even if the unlisted shares are held anytime during the financial year. Details like PAN of the company, opening balance of shares, shares acquired and transferred during the year, and closing balance of shares must be reported. \nPlease note that you cannot file ITR-1 and ITR-4 if you hold unlisted shares anytime during the year. You can file ITR-2 or ITR-3 in this case. \nThis disclosure is mandatory even if these unlisted share details are mentioned under the ‘Foreign Asset (FA)’. \nAlso, the finance ministry has widened the scope of Form 26AS to include a few new details like information related to unlisted shares. With this, the income tax department will have details of unlisted shares held by the taxpayers linked to its PAN, and any mismatch in ITR reporting could be questioned. It is advisable to verify Form 26AS or new AIS before ITR reporting. \nDirectorship details \nIf a taxpayer is a director in any Indian or a foreign company, its disclosure must be made while filing a return of income. \nIn this situation, ITR-1 and ITR-4 cannot be filed. The taxpayer can either file ITR-2 or ITR-3. \nThe taxpayer will have to mention details like DIN (directors identification number), PAN of such the company, and disclosure whether the shares of such company are listed on the recognised stock exchange or not is to be mentioned. \nSchedule AL (Assets and Liabilities’)\nTaxpayers earning more than Rs.50 lakh must provide additional disclosure under Schedule AL (assets and liabilities) in the ITR. The schedule requires disclosure of immovable as well as movable assets. Details of assets like land, building, jewellery and bullion, vehicles, bank accounts, investments in stocks and bonds, insurance policies, etc. and any corresponding liabilities are provided. \nPlease note that ITR-1 and ITR-4 are to be filed by taxpayers having income below Rs.50 lakh, and hence they do not have to furnish these details in Schedule AL. \nSchedule Foreign Assets (FA)\nResidents are required to disclose the ownership of any foreign assets or beneficial interest held in any foreign assets in Schedule Foreign Assets (FA). \nThe foreign assets required to be disclosed foreign custodial accounts, foreign equity and debt interest, foreign depository accounts, shares held in any listed or unlisted foreign company, cash value/surrender value of foreign insurance contract, trusts created under any foreign country laws in which the assessee is a trustee, any other foreign asset.\nThese amounts should be mentioned after converting them into Indian rupees. \nRemember that this disclosure is required even if the ownership is just for a single day in the entire financial year.\nThere are huge penalties for not disclosing any foreign assets or income; hence taxpayers should be meticulous in reporting all these transactions. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at jyoti.arora@cleartax.in\nI am a Chartered Accountant by profession with  4+ years of experience in the finance domain.

The key focus of the meeting shall be correcting the inverted tax structure of a few more items. It will also cater to discussions surrounding the Union Budget 2022-23.\nThe meeting will have the Union Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, as the Chairperson. It will have the presence of some experienced budget-makers and the Revenue Secretary, Tarun Bajaj. Further, the team may collate the views of all the state finance ministers regarding their expectations from the Union Budget 2022-23. The government officials have stated that the Council has not decided on the items for rate rationalisation, pending the report from a ministerial group.\nA Group of Ministers (GoM) had to review the matter based on the 45th GST Council meeting outcome. The team of ministers would look into the inverted tax structure corrections, phasing out of many GST exemptions, among other rate rationalisation matters. \nOfficial sources have stated to leading media publications that the government is not pushing for rate rationalisation sooner. With two meetings already held, the GoM wanted to wind up the study in a week but has now put its next meeting on hold without any further communication on the new date.\nThe GoM is led by Shri Basavaraj Bommai (Karnataka’s CM). It includes Shri Tarkishore Prasad (Bihar’s Deputy CM), Shri Amit Mitra (West Bengal’s Finance Minister) and Shri KN Balagopal (Kerala’s Finance Minister). The issue of rate rationalisation and restructuring will be further deferred. Accordingly, since the GoM’s report is not yet submitted, the GST Council meeting might have been delayed as well.\nAnother reason for holding the Council meeting in January 2022 is that the ongoing winter Parliamentary session will close on 23rd December 2021.

        "headline": "Should You Invest in IPOs Through Mutual Funds?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Do you want to invest in companies with high growth potential? Are you looking to build wealth over time? You could invest in an initial public offering or IPO to attain long term financial goals if it matches your risk profile. Private firms offer their shares to the public for the first time through an IPO. The privately-owned company becomes a publicly-traded company on listing its shares at the stock exchange. However, most IPOs are oversubscribed, and you may not get the IPO allotment. Should you invest in IPOs through mutual funds?\nWhat are IPOs?\nCompanies issue their shares to the public for the first time through IPOs. It helps to understand that IPOs have different investor categories such as Qualified Institutional Buyers, Non-Institutional Investors and Retail Individual Investors. Moreover, the allocation of shares differs across these groups in an IPO. \nFor instance, individual retail investors have a minimum allocation of 35% of the shares in an IPO. It helps to understand that individual retail investors apply for securities of value of up to Rs 2 lakh. Moreover, these investors are fast emerging as major players in the stock market. \nA company lists its shares on the stock exchange through the IPO and post-listing becomes a publicly-traded company. You can purchase and sell the company’s shares over the stock exchange. \nShould you invest in IPOs through equity funds?\nMany people invest in IPOs for listing gains. For instance, the shares of a company launched through the IPO are listed on the stock exchange at the listing price. However, the listing price could be higher or lower than the IPO offer price.\nYou could make profits called listing gains if the listing price is higher than the offer price because of high demand for the shares. Many investors put money in IPOs only for listing gains and then exit the investment. However, financial experts recommend investing in the IPOs of well-managed companies and staying with the investment for the long run to maximise your returns. \nYou can invest in equity funds that put most of their assets in IPOs if you cannot pick the appropriate IPO. These are thematic funds that focus on a unique investment theme: investing in firms that go public through IPOs. You do not have to concentrate on due diligence as the thematic fund picks the best IPOs and maximises return over time.\nMany investors lose out on future gains as they exit their shares immediately after listing. However, thematic funds with high exposure to IPOs can maximise your returns as they hold the investment for a longer time post listing. Many newer businesses may enjoy earnings momentum, and mutual funds stick with them for a longer time. \nMany retail investors miss out on IPO allotment in good, financially strong companies because of oversubscription. IPO allotment happens through a computerised lottery where a few lucky investors get shares through the IPO. However, mutual funds can get IPO allotment through the IPO institutional quota or anchor book subscription. Moreover, mutual funds may buy shares even after listing at the right time and hold them for the long run to increase investor returns. \nWhat are the risks of investing in IPOs through mutual funds?\nThematic funds with high exposure to IPOs may invest in new-age businesses and tech-driven firms that have yet to earn profits. Moreover, these businesses are untested across economic and business cycles. \nThematic funds may outperform other equity funds in the short run as IPOs can yield lucrative returns in a short time. However, you must not invest in these funds based on short term returns as they are riskier than many equity funds. \nYou must invest in thematic funds with high exposure to IPOs only if it matches your risk tolerance. It helps if you treat IPOs as a long term investment rather than look for listing gains. In a nutshell, you could opt for the mutual fund route to invest in IPOs if you can’t choose the right IPO. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at cleyon.dsouza@cleartax.in\nI write to make complicated financial topics, simple.

        "data": "Five significant changes are to happen from the 1st of December 2021. These changes are related to the banking and financial sector and will directly or indirectly impact a common man.  \nSBI Card levies processing fees\nIndia’s one of the largest banks, the State Bank of India (SBI), would start charging processing fees on purchases that get converted into EMI transactions (equated monthly instalments). SBI credit cardholders will be levied nominal processing fees of Rs.99 plus applicable taxes. \nPNB savings account interest slashed\nPunjab National Bank (PNB) has reduced the interest rate of the savings account holders. PNB has reduced the interest rate on savings accounts by ten basis points for the account holders maintaining the balance of less than Rs.10 lakh and five basis points for the balance above Rs.10 lakh. The interest rate will be effective from the 1st of December,2021. \nLPG Cylinder Price\nThe price of LPG (liquified petroleum gas) will be increased from the current rates starting from December 2021. The rise will be in the cost of the commercial LPG cylinders, whereas the prices of the domestic LPG cylinder has not been increased. \nThe price of 19kg commercial LPG cylinders, on average, have increased by Rs. 101 in all the states like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai. Previously the price of a 19kg commercial cylinder ranged between Rs.1950-Rs.2050 in different states, which will now see an average hike of Rs. 101 across the country.  \nLife certificate for pensioners\nA life certificate is a mandatory document to be submitted by the pensioner to the authorised pension distributor, which also proves the existence of a pensioner. Failure to submit the ‘life certificate’ before the due date interrupts the pension income. \nNow, obtaining a life certificate requires the physical presence of the pensioner. This rule becomes a problem for many older people due to which the Centre has come up with the digital life certificate where the entire procedure is done digitally. The pension earners above the age of 80 can submit their digital ‘Life certificate’ at the country’s Post Offices’ or Jeevan Pramaan Centers.\nThe due date for submission of the life certificate is the 30th of November, 2021. In case of non-compliance, your pension may be terminated starting onwards 1st of December 2021. \nMatchbox price to rise\nAfter 14 years, matchbox prices will increase from Rs.1 per matchbox to Rs.2 per matchbox starting from the 1st of December 2021. This is because of the soaring inflation that has increased the price of raw materials. Before this, matchbox prices were increased from 50 paise to Rs.1 per box in 2007. \nWith the rise in inflation in the country, consumers are witnessing an increase in the cost price of all the consumables. Inflation remains a concern for all sectors, and the government needs to take corrective measures to bring it under control. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at jyoti.arora@cleartax.in\nI am a Chartered Accountant by profession with  4+ years of experience in the finance domain.

        "headline": "IT: Conditions attached with the LIC premium deduction under Section 80C",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The Income Tax Act provides tax benefits if you pay the premium of a life insurance policy or a Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP). It also provides tax exemption for maturity proceeds received from a life insurance or ULIP plan. Let us understand the law in detail.\nTax benefit in respect of premium paid for life insurance policies\nSection 80C of the Income Tax Act allows an individual and a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) to claim a deduction of Rs.1.50 lakh on certain eligible expenditures and investments. One of the items is the premium paid for a life insurance policy. \nThe deduction is not product-specific, and you can claim it for premiums paid on term plans and for a product like ULIPs as well. Individuals can take the tax benefit if they pay a premium for the life insurance of self, spouse or any of their children. The deduction is not available if the life insurance premium is paid for parents, even if they are financially dependent on the taxpayer. A HUF can claim the deduction for the premium paid for policies taken on the life of any HUF member.\nWhat are the conditions to avail of the deduction?\nAnnual premium to not exceed a certain limit\nTo claim the deduction, the annual premium amount should not exceed 10% of the sum assured for the policy issued after 1st April 2012. For the policies issued before 1st April 2012, the premium paid should not exceed 20% of the sum assured to claim this deduction. However, note that for a policy issued after 1st April 2013, which covers the life of an individual with a disease referred to under Section 80DDB or a disability referred to under Section 80U, the premium amount should not exceed 15% of the sum assured to claim the deduction under Section 80C.\nReversal of deductions\nIf you have claimed tax benefit on the life insurance policy, the policy needs to be kept active for two years. If the policy lapses within two years, the deductions allowed in earlier years are reversed and added back to the year’s income in which the policy lapsed. \nTax treatment of money received from an insurance company\nWhen the premium paid on the policy does not exceed 10% of the sum assured for life insurance policies issued after 1st April 2012 and 20% of sum assured for life insurance policies issued before 1st April 2012– any amount received on maturity or such policy or amount received as a bonus is fully exempt from tax under Section 10(10D). Also covered here are policies taken after 1st April 2013, on the life of a person with a disability or a disease specified under Sections 80U and 80DDB, respectively, where the amount received on maturity is tax-free provided the premium paid not to exceed 15% of the sum assured.\nWhere the premium amount paid is more than 10%, 15%, or 20% of the sum assured, as the case may be, the maturity proceeds shall be fully taxable under the heading “Income from other sources”.\nTax treatment of money received from ULIP\nAdditionally, the returns out of the ULIPs on maturity are exempt from income tax under Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act. However, any return on the ULIP investment, where the annual premium is above Rs 2.5 lakh a year, is taxable as per the new amendment in Budget 2021. The taxability will depend upon the fund’s exposure in equity or debt. Suppose the funds have more than 65% investment in equity instruments. In that case, the tax will be calculated as per taxation of equity mutual funds, i.e. the gains above Rs 100,000 shall be taxable at the rate of 10% without indexation. Otherwise, the tax calculation will work like debt funds. The tax rates will depend upon the holding period, i.e., they are chargeable to tax at slab rate if held for a period less than 36 months and at the rate of 20% with indexation if held for 36 months or more.\nTDS on maturity proceeds of the policy\nFrom October 2014, if the maturity amount received from a life insurance policy is more than Rs 1,00,000 on policies not covered under an exemption under Section 10(10D), the insurer has to deduct TDS at 1% before making payment. The insurer shall also deduct TDS on bonus payments. However, if the maturity proceeds are less than Rs 1,00,000, no TDS shall be deducted, but the amount received shall be fully taxable in the taxpayer’s hands. You can claim credit for the TDS deducted from your income tax return. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at namita.shah@cleartax.in\nI’m a chartered accountant and a functional CA writer by profession.  Reading and travelling in free time enhances my creativity in work.

        "headline": "Income tax: Know the rules of clubbing income",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The clubbing of income in the Income Tax Act means to include the income of another person in the taxpayer’s total income. If a person diverts any income source to another person’s name, he cannot free himself from paying taxes on such income. If he does so, he has to club the income derived from the transferred asset in his total income and pay tax on it. \nThe clubbing provision is not applicable in all cases, but it is applicable in certain specified cases. Let us see where the clubbing provision applies. \nTransfer of income without transfer of assets\nSuppose you own a property and have given the property on rent at Rs 10,000 to your friend. Further, you have directed the tenant to pay the whole amount of rent to your friend. In this case, you have transferred the income to your friend without transferring him the asset. In such cases, the income tax on such rent income shall be paid by you and not by your friend. \nIncome from assets transferred to spouse/daughter-in-law\nIf a person transfers the asset to their spouse without consideration, the income generated from such asset shall be taxable to the person who transfers the asset. The asset also includes money.\nSo if a person transfers Rs 10 lakh to his spouse and the spouse invests the money, say in fixed deposits, the income generated from such fixed deposits is taxable in the hands of the person who has transferred the money(transferor) and not in the hands of the spouse. It is irrespective of whose name the fixed deposits are. The transaction of transferring money to the spouse will not attract tax, but the income generated from investing such money will attract tax in the hands of the transferor.\nSimilarly, suppose any person transfers any asset to their son’s wife (daughter-in-law) name without adequate consideration. In that case, the income from such an asset will be clubbed in the hands of the transferor.\nClubbing provisions not applicable\nOne should note that no clubbing provision will apply if adequate consideration is paid to the transferor by the transferee. Additionally, the relationship of husband and wife should exist both at the time of transfer of money/property and accrual of income to attract clubbing provisions. For example, no clubbing of income is required if money is transferred before marriage and income is accrued after marriage. In such cases, the income accrued will be taxable in the hands of the person to whom the asset was transferred. Similarly, if there is no husband-wife relationship on the date of accrual of income (for example, divorce), the income will not be clubbed in the hands of the transferor. \nMinor child’s income\nThe income of a minor child is clubbed with the income of their parents. The parent who clubs the income can claim an exemption of Rs 1,500 as per the Income Tax Act. However, the clubbing provisions will not apply if the income is earned by the minor child’s skills, knowledge, and experience.\nHence, it is necessary to comply with the income tax law and disclose all the income, including the income from clubbing, while filing the income tax return. \nJoin our Telegram channel to keep getting updates on all things finance.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at  namita.shah@cleartax.in\nI’m a chartered accountant and a functional CA writer by profession.  Reading and travelling in free time enhances my creativity in work.

They can claim a 30% standard deduction and also reduce property taxes from the rental income.\nWhat documents are required to claim HRA exemption?\nYou can enter into a rental agreement with your parents. You can also prepare monthly rent receipts. The employers generally ask for a copy of rent receipts to allow you HRA exemption for calculating TDS to be deducted from your salary. It is essential to keep such records if the income tax department asks you to justify your claim of HRA exemption.\nImportant things to remember\nHowever, one has to take care of the below points while claiming HRA exemption:\nHence, even if you stay with your parents, you can benefit from HRA exemption and save taxes. Also, if your parents are in a lower tax bracket than you, the family can save taxes as a whole. Moreover, senior citizens will enjoy a higher basic exemption limit (Rs 3 lakh for senior citizens whose age falls between 60-80 years and Rs 5 lakh for those above 80 years of age).\nJoin our Telegram channel to keep getting updates on all things finance.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at  namita.shah@cleartax.in\nI’m a chartered accountant and a functional CA writer by profession.  Reading and travelling in free time enhances my creativity in work.

However, this extension is applicable when the original due date falls between 01.03.2020 to 31.08.2021. Also, the taxpayer can apply irrespective of the status of such applications, which is explained in the table below:\nUsually, the taxpayer has to apply for revocation of cancellation of registration within 30 days from the date of receiving the cancellation order. However, the CBIC has inserted a new provision to extend the time for applying for revocation of cancellation of registration. The Additional/Joint Commissioner can extend the time limit by 30 days, and the Commissioner can extend it by another 30 days.\nSo, in total, a taxpayer gets a time limit of 90 days (initial 30 days + additional 60 days) to apply for revocation. Few taxpayers are concerned whether they can avail these extensions from the department from the revised deadline, i.e., 30.09.2021 or not?

        "data": "The government had mentioned earlier that there would be no outright ban on cryptocurrencies; however, no clarity was provided on how the government plans to handle virtual coin trade in India.\nThere needs to be more clarity if cryptocurrencies have to be considered as services, commodities, or similar to equities; only then virtual coins can be regulated or taxed. This is the reason the government is aiming to define cryptocurrencies via a draft bill. By defining cryptocurrencies clearly, it will be easy to outline how they need to be taxed and regulated in the future.\nThe government will likely develop a draft cryptocurrency bill that will talk about the definition of virtual coins; how these coins will be regulated and taxed. It has been anticipated that the new bill will outline the tax treatment of digital assets and define how digital assets will be classified.\nThis move has come at a time wherein the cryptocurrency trade is booming in India rapidly. Domestic cryptocurrency exchanges have witnessed an acute increase in trading volumes. Hence, they requested the government to regulate the virtual coin trade versus imposing a ban.\nCryptocurrency exchanges have mentioned several times that there is a  need for considering cryptocurrency tokens as digital assets versus currencies, and consequently, define policies related to crypto trade.\nCurrently, in India, there is no legal status for cryptocurrency, and it remains unregulated. The draft crypto bill could define the virtual coin trade’s future in India.\nThe draft cryptocurrency bill may classify cryptocurrencies depending on the technology they use. However, the primary focus will be to categorise depending on the assets’ end-usage concerning regulatory purposes. This move will probably benefit you as a cryptocurrency investor as this move will introduce the much-awaited concrete law that would regulate virtual coin trading.\nThere is also anticipation that the draft cryptocurrency bill might also determine how taxes will be imposed on cryptocurrency investments. The new crypto bill will assist authorities in registering cryptocurrency trade under tax and in the books of accounts accordingly.

        "data": "The tax provisions relating to the investments in Provident Fund have remained unchanged for many years. As per the previous law, a portion of 12% of salary had to be contributed by the employer and employee. Any excess employer contribution above 12% of the salary was taxable.\nHowever, in the Union Budget 2020, employers contribution to Provident Fund, National Pension Scheme (NPS) and Superannuation Fund over Rs.7,50,000 was brought under the ambit of taxability. Any excess contribution beyond Rs.7,50,000 would be taxed as perquisites in the hands of the employee. The amendment intended to bring the high-income earners excess benefits under the taxability net.  \nFurther, the Union Budget 2021 introduced taxability on the interest accrued on the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) account for contributions over Rs.2,50,000. The government intended to rationalise the tax exemption for the high-income earners who earned tax-free income by putting a threshold limit.  \nToday, CBDT issued a notification stating how the taxable interest will be calculated relating to the contribution to the Provident Fund or Recognised Provident Fund.\nThis amendment in the income tax rule shall become applicable from 1 April 2022. \nThe notification stated that for calculating the Provident Fund contribution taxable interest, separate accounts should be maintained for all the financial years starting from the current financial year 2021-22. Two different accounts, one with taxable contribution and another with non-taxable contribution, shall be maintained for all the subscribers. \nCalculation of non-taxable contribution\n (A)- Aggregate of the following:\n(B) – Reduced by withdrawal from such an account. \nCalculation of non-taxable contribution = (A) Less (B)\nCalculation of taxable contribution \n (A)- Aggregate of the following:\n(B) – Reduced by withdrawal from such an account. \nCalculation of taxable contribution = (A) Less (B)\nThe threshold limit for non-taxable Provident Fund contribution for employees where the employer does not contribute is Rs.5,00,000 (as amended).

        "headline": "Looking to Save More Tax this Year? 5 Investment Options to explore",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The Income Tax Act has provided investment options to save tax and build the habit of savings and investment amongst the taxpayers. Here are five investment options that help you save taxes and also secure your future:\nELSS funds majorly invest in equity and equity-linked securities like listed equity shares of the corporates. They also invest some portion towards fixed income securities.\nELSS schemes are mutual fund schemes eligible for tax deductions under Section 80C within the limit of Rs.1.5 lakh. These schemes have a lock-in period of a minimum of three years, which is the shortest amongst all the 80C tax-saving investments. \nAlso, you should note that there are no provisions for a premature exit in ELSS. However, ELSS funds are the only tax saving options with the potential to offer inflation-beating returns. \nInvesting in ELSS provides twin benefits of tax deduction and wealth creation. ELSS funds also offer SIP (Systematic Investment Plan), which helps to stagger the investment over a period of time, thereby giving the benefit of rupee cost averaging and compounding. These funds offer a maximum return if invested for the long term. ELSS is one of the most lucrative and high return tax-saving options.  \nThe National Pension System (NPS) is a pension scheme sponsored by the government. It is open to all citizens aged between 18 to 70 years. Non-resident Indians (NRIs) can also invest in NPS.\nInvestors in NPS get the twin benefits of pension in retirement and tax deductions. A portion of the NPS investment goes to equities (this may not offer guaranteed returns). However, there is a cap in the range of 50% to 75% on equity exposure for the NPS. The equity portion is reduced by 2.5% each year beginning from when the investor turns 50 years of age.\nThe lock-in period in the NPS scheme is till retirement. However, one cannot withdraw the entire corpus, even post-retirement. Minimum 40% of the corpus is set aside to receive a regular monthly pension. \nThere are two different accounts under the NPS called the Tier I and Tier II account. \nInvestments in the NPS are deployed under the following broad asset classes:\nThe NPS offers two investment choices called the active choice and the auto choice. Active choice allows investors to decide how much money should be invested in different asset classes of E, C, G, and A subject to a max of 75% in equity. At the same time, auto choice allows the investor to invest money in different asset classes of E, C, G and A depending on the subscriber’s age.\nThe returns offered by the scheme are much higher than other traditional tax-saving investments like the PPF.\nNPS investments qualify for deduction under section 80CCD(1), 80CCD (2), and 80CCD (1B).\nUnder Section 80CCD (1) maximum deduction allowed is 10% (20% of gross income in case of the self-employed taxpayer) of the salary, within the overall limit of Rs.1.5 lakh. \nSection 80CCD(2) allows a deduction for the employer’s NPS contribution, which will not form a part of Section 80C. \nFurther, Finance Act 2020 had imposed a limit of Rs.7.5 lakh for the employer’s contribution towards NPS, PF and superannuation fund. Amount exceeding this would be taxable in the hands of the employee as perquisites. \nThe maximum amount allowed for deduction under 80CCD (1B) will be the lowest of the below:\nSection 80CCD (1B) allows you to claim a deduction of Rs.50,000 (over and above Rs.1.5 lakh limit under the umbrella limit of section 80C) for self contribution.\nThe investor can avail of a total deduction of up to Rs.2 lakh in this scheme.\nParents (or legal guardians) of a girl child aged less than 10 years can open the account under this scheme. The resident girl child will be the beneficiary of the account from the time of the opening of the account till the time of maturity/closure. \nThe parent (or legal guardian) may deposit the amount and can operate the SSY account. After the girl attains 18 years of age, the account has to be mandatorily operated by her. \nA parent (or legal guardian) can open this account for a maximum of two girl children (including adopted children). \nInvestments made in the SSY scheme are eligible for deductions under Section 80C, subject to a maximum cap of Rs.1.5 lakh. The interest that accrues against this account which gets compounded annually is also exempt from tax. The proceeds received upon maturity/withdrawal are also exempt from income tax.\nA ULIP scheme is a combination of both insurance plus an investment scheme. The policy covers the death benefit (in case of the policy holder’s death) plus a fixed return benefit after the policy term. Some part of the premium goes towards life insurance under this scheme, whereas some will be towards investment in equity and/or debt. \nThe policy-holder has an option to choose between various funds and asset classes. The investments made are subject to the market risk borne by the investor like any other market investment. Thus the policyholder should make a choice of the funds and asset class after evaluating the risk appetite.   \nThe investment in the ULIP scheme qualifies for deduction under Section 80C up to Rs.1.5 lakh. Also, the investor can withdraw funds only after the lock-in of 5 years. \nHowever, it is advisable to have a term insurance cover that is comparatively cost-effective than the death cover offered by these schemes. For investment, ELSS funds offer better returns with a shorter lock-in than ULIP plans. Hence, a combination of term life insurance and ELSS can give you the benefit of the ULIP plans.  \nFive-year tax-saving FD is one of the most hassle tax-saving investments. Deposit in tax saving FD can be made online if the investor has a know-your-customer (KYC) compliant bank account and internet banking facility. While creating the tax saving FD online, one should ensure that the auto-renewal option is disabled or else the tax-saving FD will auto-renew on the day of the maturity for the next five years. This is because premature withdrawal is not allowed in the case of a tax-saving FD. \nBanks offer two kinds of interest payment options (i) cumulative (ii) non-cumulative. The interest earned through both options is taxable and added to the total income of the investor. \nHowever, it is to be noted that the interest rates offered by the FD’s are not sufficient to beat inflation and create wealth in the long term. Also, for individuals falling under the highest tax bracket of 30%, the post-tax return could offer meagre actual returns. \nHere is a comparative analysis of returns and lock-in of all of these investments\n*These returns are subject to changes from time to time according to government regulation\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at jyoti.arora@cleartax.in\nI am a Chartered Accountant by profession with  4+ years of experience in the finance domain.

        "headline": "Income tax return: Know how to disclose capital gains in ITR forms",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The income tax return filing date, which is 30th September for the AY 2021-22 for individual taxpayers, is approaching soon. \nReviewing your Form 16 will not give you an idea of the actual tax liability, as it will not have any other income like capital gains income earned by you during the financial year. It would help if you remembered to report all your gains or losses from selling shares, mutual fund (MF) units, gold, or property. \nLet us see how to calculate capital gains for different asset classes and how to disclose them in your income tax return.\nIrrespective of the amount gained or lost, one must disclose capital gains or losses while filing Income Tax Return (ITR). \nWhat is capital gain? \nCapital gains are the profits earned from the transfer of the capital assets such as shares and stocks, bonds, mutual fund units, gold, property, etc.\nThe capital gains are of two types (depending on the period of holding of the capital asset by the current owner):\nThe Income Tax Act has specified different tenure for different classes of assets that we have discussed below. \nAlso, the capital gain is calculated as the value of sale consideration over the cost of the acquisition of the asset transferred. However, even these rules are different for various assets. \nFor better understanding, let us classify the assets into three categories:\nImmovable property\nThe period of holding for capital gains for real estate property like land, house, apartment etc., is considered two years. This means if a property is sold after holding it for two years, it will be regarded as long-term capital gains, whereas if it is sold within a holding period of two years, it will be regarded as short-term capital gains. LTCG tax rate is 20% with indexation, while STCG is taxed at the individual’s slab rate.\nShort-term capital gain (STCG)\n= Full sale consideration – (Cost of transfer +Cost of acquisition + Cost of improvement). \nWhereas the formula for calculating LTCG is:\nLong-term capital gain (LTCG)\n = Full sale consideration – (Cost of transfer +Indexed cost of acquisition + Indexed cost of improvement)\nFirstly, to calculate LTCG, you should calculate the indexed cost of acquisition (COA). The formula for calculating it is as follows:\nIndexed COA = Cost of acquisition x Notified cost inflation index (CII) for the year of sale/CII of the year of purchase) \nIndexed cost of improvement = Cost of improvement x CII of the year of transfer/CII of the year of improvement. \nHowever, it is to be noted that the base year for the Cost of Index calculation was revised to 2001-02 in Finance Act 2017. Hence, for assets bought before 2001, FMV as of 1st April 2001 is required to calculate the indexed cost of acquisition further. \nFor instance, if you bought a property in 1997, you first need to calculate the FMV of the property as of 1st April 2001 and then index the cost per the above-mentioned formula, considering 2001 as the base year for CII. \nAlso, with the revision of the base year of CII, the cost of improvement shall include only those capital expenditures incurred after 1.04.2001. \nIn the case of property received in an inheritance or as a gift, the previous owners’ cost of acquisition and holding period should be considered for calculating capital gains. \nThe LTCG tax on the property can be reduced by reinvesting the capital gains to purchase another residential property under Section 54 or purchase of a specified infrastructure bond under Section 54EC within the time prescribed. \nEquity and equity-linked instruments:\nThe holding period for classification between short term and long term in equity or equity-oriented mutual funds is one year. Hence, if the equity stocks are sold within a year of purchase, it will be considered STCG, whereas transfer of these shares after a year is considered LTCG. \nTax on STCG for equity or equity-related instruments is at the rate of 15%. At the same time, LTCG is taxable at 10% on amounts exceeding Rs.1 lakh in a financial year. Surcharge and cess apply to these rates.  \nThere is also a provision of grandfathering\nCBDT has introduced a grandfathering clause for calculating the cost of acquisition for long-term capital gains to ensure that the tax is only prospective in nature. This was to make the gains from the date of announcement only taxable. Therefore, the acquisition cost must be calculated as per a specified formula to ensure investments made before February 1, 2018, remain tax-exempt. Grandfathering clause will protect your  LTCG made up till 31 January. Only the gains made after that date will be taxed. \nThe cost of acquisition as per grandfathering clause is to be calculated as follows:\nOther assets like gold, bonds,  debt instruments, jewellery, liquid investments, etc. \nThe holding period for other assets like gold, bullion, jewellery, debt instruments, bonds etc., will be considered as three years (36 months). Any gain on the transfer of these assets within three years of holding will be considered short-term gains, and gains on more than three years of holding will be regarded as long-term gains. LTCG rate on these assets is 20% after indexation, whereas STCG is taxed as per income tax slabs. \nSet-off and carry forward\nA short-term capital loss can be set off against the STCG or LTCG of the same year. Also, it can be carried forward to subsequent financial years for set-off. However, long-term capital loss (LTCL) can be set off only against the LTCG and no other income. \nTax exemptions on capital gains \nSection 54 of the Income Tax Act allows the taxpayer to claim capital gain tax exemption if the gain is fully utilised to purchase another house. The seller of the property can buy a new house within one year or two years after (three years in case of construction) from the date of sale of the previous property. \nThe taxpayer can claim exemption from the capital gain by investing in bonds issued by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) or Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) under Section 54EC. The maximum exemption that can be claimed under this section is Rs.50 lakh. \nAlso if the taxpayer needs time to buy the right property,  then capital gain tax can be saved by depositing the gain amount in the Capital Gains Accounts Scheme (CGAS) of any notified public sector bank. This amount can then be claimed for tax exemption. However, you are required to invest this money within the specified time allowed under the section for availing of the exemption. \nAgricultural land in rural areas, not within the specified limits of the city, is exempt from the capital gain tax. \nApart from these, other exemptions are available under section 54 to Section 54F, under which the taxpayer can claim exemption by further investing.\nDisclosing gains in ITR\nOnce you have arrived at the capital gains or losses figure for the financial year, you will have to report it in your ITR forms.\nTheir income tax department has notified different ITR forms based on the type and amount of income.\nSalaried individuals with capital gains income are required to file ITR-2, whereas individuals having business income can file ITR-3 if they also have capital gains income.\nThe taxpayers have to report the capital gain income under schedule CG in the ITR forms. The requirements to report the capital gain income are extensive and depend upon the type of asset sold and holding period, long term or short term. \nIn the case of immovable property, additional details like the PAN/ Aadhaar of the buyer, address and PIN code of the property are to be disclosed along with the sale, purchase, and transfer expenses. \nIn case of long-term gain on equity stocks, a separate schedule 112A needs to be filled, which requires scrip wise reporting. Details like share/unit acquired, ISIN code, number of shares/units, the full value of consideration, cost of acquisition, details of FMV as of 1.02.2018 for grandfather rule compliance, expenses of transfer, etc., is required to be filled.  \nEven if you claim full exemption of capital gains by investing in specified assets, it is to be reported fully in the ITR. \nThe income tax department has become vigilant and tracks all the transactions of the PAN holders. Non-reporting or under-reporting of such income can be easily tracked, resulting in penalty, fine or proceedings. If you are unsure how and where to disclose your capital gain income, you may consider taking the tax experts’ assistance to file your ITR.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at jyoti.arora@cleartax.in\nI am a Chartered Accountant by profession with  4+ years of experience in the finance domain.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Finance has always been a topic of intrigue. The lack of financial literacy is the cause of countless unfortunate events like scams, frauds, and Ponzi schemes. With the rise in finance-based topics in popular and social media, the public has become aware of such events. On the other hand, they also show the glitz and glamour of the world where high risk gives high rewards. However, these only scratch the surface. \nInvestments will always remain fascinating because of the potential of wealth creation. This article covers some of the common mistakes while investing. \nReasons for investing\nAlways remember why you are investing. Have a realistic idea of your financial situation and set long term and short-term goals. This information will help you align your investments with the goals accordingly. These factors will also define why you would choose a particular financial instrument. \nLooking for the ideal time\nIt is often advised to start investing as soon as possible. It isn’t easy to time the market correctly. Markets usually go through seasonality and multiple cycles. For long-term financial goals, it is preferable to avoid considering the short term volatility of the market and keep your eye on the prize. \nDetermining based on past performance\nOften the past returns become a significant factor in choosing a financial instrument. It is imperative to look at the whole picture of why that particular instrument gave those returns at that time. Sometimes, assets that have been performing very well might get overvalued and become risky choices. \nNot diversifying and keeping a regular check\nDiversifying portfolios is essential for risk management by allocating investments in various industries using different financial instruments. Not only does it mitigate risk, but it also opens you up to more opportunities for returns. Investing in different industries also reduces your exposure to adverse market conditions.\nKeeping a regular check on your portfolio helps you understand which assets are performing and which are not. Reviewing will also help you in minimising your losses. \nNot keeping an emergency corpus\nAn emergency corpus is built over a period with discipline. It is primarily made for uncertain times, like medical emergencies, unexpected job losses, etc. Emergency corpus safeguards your future investments, such as your retirement plans or children’s education plans. If you ever need to use the corpus, always put in the same amount as soon as possible. For medical emergencies, you can also have health insurance cover. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at jyotsna.singh@cleartax.in\nI am a Content Writer at Clear.

        "headline": "Will RBI’s New Scheme for Retailers Affect Gilt Funds?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Are you looking at fixed-income investments to strengthen your portfolio? Do you want to invest in government bonds for the long term? You may consider investing in gilt funds. It is a debt fund that invests mainly in government securities. However, the RBI recently unveiled an ‘RBI Retail Direct’ scheme where retail investors can invest directly in government bonds. Will RBI’s new scheme for retail investors affect gilt funds?\nWhat are gilt funds?\nYou have gilt funds as a type of debt fund that invests a minimum of 80% of their assets in government securities. Moreover, you have two types of gilt funds. For instance, gilt funds invest predominantly in government securities across maturities and those with a constant maturity of 10 years. \nYou have gilt funds investing in government securities that have zero default risk. However, they are impacted by interest rate fluctuations in the economy as their portfolio has government bonds of a longer duration. \nShould you invest in gilt funds?\nYou may invest in gilt funds if you are a savvy investor who understands the bond market. It helps as these funds invest in government bonds of a longer duration and are affected by interest rate movements. You may consider gilt funds if you have an investment horizon of three to five years. \nYou will have to time your entry and exit in gilt funds to realise a higher return. Moreover, you must invest in these funds when interest rates are falling. For example, the demand for government securities issued earlier rises when the RBI cuts interest rates in the economy as they have a higher interest rate. The price of these securities rises when the demand goes up even as bond yields fall.\nYou have an inverse relationship between the price of bonds and their yield. For instance, if the RBI cuts interest rates in the economy, the price of government bonds of a longer duration will rise. As gilt funds invest predominantly in these bonds, their NAV also goes up. \nHowever, if the RBI increases the interest rates in the economy, the price of government bonds of a longer duration will fall. You will find the NAV of gilt funds falling in a rising interest rate scenario. \nWhat is the Retail Direct Gilt Account?\nYou have the RBI issuing a scheme where retail investors can purchase and sell government securities. It helps you invest in sovereign gold bonds, state development loans, treasury bills and Government of India dated securities through the Retail Direct Gilt Account. \nYou may invest in this scheme if you are a resident individual with a savings bank account or an NRI who complies with the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. Moreover, you can invest in the Retail Direct Gilt Account through an online portal only after completing your KYC (Know Your Customer) documentation. \nRetail investors can invest in government securities in primary and secondary government bond markets through this scheme. Earlier, only institutional investors such as foreign portfolio investors, high net worth individuals, insurance companies and mutual funds could invest in government securities. Now, even retail investors can trade in government securities with a minimum investment of only Rs 10,000. \nWill RBI’s new scheme for retailers affect gilt funds?\nYou can invest directly in government securities through RBI’s Retail Direct Gilt Account only if you understand these investments. Moreover, it would help if you held these securities until maturity to avoid capital losses. \nIf you sell these government securities before maturity in the secondary market, the returns depend on the interest rate trends in the economy. Moreover, adverse movements in interest rates could result in losses when trading government securities in the secondary market. \nYou may consider investing in gilt funds instead of directly investing in government securities if you are a novice investor in bonds. It helps as the fund manager and the research team buy and sell government securities to maximise returns based on the interest rate movements. Moreover, as many investors in India are first-timers in the bond market, the new scheme won’t significantly impact gilt funds. \nYou must invest in gilt funds only if you can time your entry and exit in these schemes. Moreover, it helps if you understand the impact of interest rate fluctuations on your investment. Gilt funds have an average portfolio maturity ranging from three to five years. In a nutshell, you must invest in gilt funds only if you understand bond markets and have a longer time horizon to achieve your financial goals. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at cleyon.dsouza@cleartax.in\nI write to make complicated financial topics, simple.

This year, the 31st July tax-filing deadline for the financial year 2020-21 has been postponed to 30th September 2021 for tax filers other than tax audit cases. While this gives taxpayers two more months, it is still just about enough time to get all of their documents, details and deductions in order. \nIndian tax laws allow taxpayers to claim tax deductions on certain investments and payments made during the financial year. Let’s look at these nine important tax deductions that you can claim while filing your income tax return this year as a salaried individual.\n1. An investment made in the National Pension Scheme (NPS)\nSection 80CCD (1b) of the Income Tax Act allows taxpayers to claim a deduction of up to Rs.50,000 towards payment made to the Central Government’s Pension Scheme. This is excluding any deduction already claimed under Section 80CCD. \nFurther, under Section 80CCD(2), a deduction of the contribution made by an employer to the Central Government’s Pension Scheme is allowed. There are two conditions to be satisfied here:\ni) For individuals employed by state governments, PSUs, or private entities, the deduction limit is capped at 10% of basic salary plus Dearness Allowance (DA).\nii) For individuals employed by the Central Government, the deduction limit is capped at 14% of basic salary plus DA.\n2. Payments made for life insurance, provident fund, childrens’ tuition, etc.\nSection 80C of the Income Tax Act allows deductions for expenditure incurred towards life insurance premiums, provident fund, investments in National Savings Certificates (NSC), tuition fees paid for up to two children, Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS), ULIP, tax-saving fixed deposits for five years, principal repayment of housing loan, etc. \nFurther, Section 80CCC covers deductions of payments made to annuity pension plans. Section 80 CCD(1) allows a deduction on payments made to Central Government pension schemes but is limited to 10% of salary. All deductions made under these Sections have a blanket cap of Rs.1.5 lakh per annum.\n3. Payments made for health insurance\nSection 80D of the Income Tax Act allows for a deduction of a health insurance premium paid. Here, a deduction of Rs.25,000 per annum can be claimed for an individual, their spouse and dependent children. The limit is increased to Rs.50,000 in the case of senior citizens. Likewise, deductions are available for health insurance premiums paid for parents. The limits of Rs.25,000 and Rs.50,000 apply depending on the age of the parents. For preventive health checkups, a deduction of Rs.5,000 is allowed but within limits specified. \n4. Interest paid on education loan\nUnder Section 80E of the Income Tax Act, interest payments on higher education loans are eligible for a tax deduction. The loan should be taken from a financial institution or an approved charitable institution. The loan should be only for the salaried employee, their spouse or dependent children. This is one of the rare deductions without an upper limit.\n5. Interest paid on housing loan\nIf a salaried employee owns a house property, he can claim a deduction under Section 24(b) of the Income Tax Act. This deduction is for the interest payment on his housing loan. Note that the principal component of the loan is already covered under Section 80C. The deduction is capped at Rs.2 lakh per annum in the case of self-occupied house properties.\n6. Additional interest on housing loans\nInterest paid on housing loans is also covered under Section 80EE and 80EEA of the Income Tax Act. However, these sections have certain restrictions on the loan values and house property values and are available only to first-time home buyers. 80EE is applicable for loans sanctioned between 1st April 2016 and 31st March 2017 and is capped at Rs.1.5 lakh per annum. 80EEE is applicable for loans sanctioned between 1st April 2019 and 31st March 2022. The deduction under Section 80EEA is capped at Rs.50,000 per annum. The taxpayer should not have claimed a deduction under Section 80EE to claim the 80EEA deduction.\n7. Interest paid on electric vehicle loans\nBudget 2019 introduced an incentive for the purchase of electric vehicles. A new Section 80EEB was introduced, allowing individual taxpayers to deduce their electric vehicle loans. The deduction is restricted to Rs.1,50,000 and is available provided the loan has been sanctioned between 1st April 2019 and 31st March 2023.\n8. Expenses incurred on a disabled dependent\nSection 80DD of the Income Tax Act provides for a deduction of expenditure that has been incurred on a disabled dependent. It could be for the dependent’s medical treatment or maintenance. This deduction is allowed only if the taxpayer has not already claimed a deduction under Section 80U of the Act. The deduction amount is Rs.75,000 or Rs.1,25,000, depending on the severity of the disability as specified under the Income Tax Act.\n9. House rent paid (for salaried individuals without HRA)\nUnder Section 80GG of the Income Tax Act, salaried individuals can claim a tax deduction on the rent paid to their landlord. However, this deduction applies only when there is no House Rent Allowance (HRA) received from the employer. One more condition to be fulfilled here is that the employee, their spouse or minor child should not own any residential accommodation at their place of work.\nThe deduction is limited to least of the following: \ni) Rs.5,000 per month\nii) 25% of the total income (excluding long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains under section 111A, income under Section 115A or 115D, and deductions under 80C to 80U. Also, the income is calculated before making a deduction under section 80GG).\niii) Actual rent paid minus 10% of total income\n\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "headline": "Section 206AB and Section 206CCA: Compliance Check Functionality Introduced",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "To help the tax deductor or the collector comply with two new sections, 206AB and 206CCA of the Income Tax Act, the income tax department developed a compliance check functionality. The CBDT released a circular dated 21st June 2021 introducing and specifying the use of the new functionality. Section 206AB and section 206CCA were inserted by the Finance Act 2021. With effect from 1st July 2021, it requires the tax deduction at source (TDS) or collection at source (TCS) at higher rates in the specified persons. The Act defines a specified person as:\nIf the deductee or the collectee satisfies both the above conditions, then the tax deductor or the collector has to deduct or collect tax at the rate twice the prescribed rate provided in the Act or 5%, whichever is higher. \nTo comply with the provision mentioned above, the tax deductor or the collector has to verify whether the deductee or the collectee is a specified person or not. Hence, during the FY 2021-22, the deductor or the collector needs to verify whether the deductee or the collectee have filed their ITR returns for the FY 2018-19 and FY 2019-20 (ITR filing due date under section 139(1) expired). And the aggregate amount of TDS and TCS during these financial years.\nThe taxpayers can use the new functionality through the reporting portal of the income tax department. The deductors or the collectors can either check a single PAN or check multiple PANs at a time from the utility. On a single PAN search, the response will be displayed on the screen, which is downloadable in PDF format. The response for bulk search would be in the form of a downloadable file. \nTo ease the burden of repeatedly checking PANs, the income tax department clarifies that the PAN(s) once checked in the financial year and marked as non-specified need not be re-checked. There will be no addition of any names to the list of specified persons once prepared at the beginning of the financial year. \nHowever, there may be chances that the specified persons may move out of the list during the financial year. Hence, re-checking will be required when making tax deductions or tax collections for these (specified person) PAN(s).\nFor example, if the TDS deductor has verified 10 PANs of the deductees through a bulk search facility at the beginning of the financial year. And it is identified that 2 out of 10 deductees are specified persons. So while tax deductions, the deductor needs to re-check the PAN of two specified persons if they are removed from the list of the specified persons.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at namita.shah@cleartax.in\nI’m a chartered accountant and a functional CA writer by profession.  Reading and travelling in free time enhances my creativity in work.

        "headline": "Are You Filing ITR This Year? Bear in Mind These Important Points",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The due date for filing income tax returns (ITR) for a financial year (FY) is usually 31st July of the succeeding FY. However, for FY 20-21, the government has extended the due date by two months until 30th September 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns imposed. This gives taxpayers ample time to file their tax returns without violating the deadline and being subjected to late fees.\nPaying taxes and filing tax returns on time is the duty of every citizen of India. Hence, every taxpayer wishes to submit an accurate and timely return while ensuring efficiencies in tax savings. This article is not about saving tax but instead covers the important points to bear in mind before you submit your ITR for FY 20-21.\nBudget 2020 introduced a new tax regime that offers taxpayers the option to pay tax at lower rates. Taxpayers can choose to pay tax under the new tax regime, provided they do not claim any deductions or exemptions. It is best that you, as a salaried person, plan your tax-saving investments, if any, at the beginning of the financial year. For FY 21-22, it is possible to do so now. But for FY 20-21, in case you have missed making any tax-saving investments and do not have any deductions to claim from your gross income, then the new tax regime may give you lower tax liability. It would help if you calculated your taxes under both tax regimes before you file your returns to choose which regime is more apt for you.\n \nAt the beginning of every assessment year (AY), the income tax department notifies the ITR forms after updating them with the relevant new changes. For example, let’s take Form ITR-1, which is used by individuals having income from salary, one house property and income from other sources, with a few exceptions. For example, this form cannot be filed by a person for whom tax deducted at source (TDS) has been deducted for a cash withdrawal under Section 194N. In addition, ITR-1 can also not be filed by employees whose tax has been deferred regarding their employee stock options (ESOPs) allotted by an eligible startup. Hence, it is necessary to bear these changes in mind before choosing an ITR form.\nSalaried employees are required to submit a declaration at the beginning of an FY with all the tax-saving investments and deductions that they propose to make during the FY. During the FY, there is usually a cut-off date to submit these investment proofs. If you have forgotten to submit the same, worry not because you can claim the applicable deductions when filing your ITR. \nThis year, taxpayers also benefit from getting information like interest earned, capital gains on mutual funds and shares, dividend received, etc., pre-filled in their ITR. You will need to verify these details with the relevant documents you have carefully. Hence, it is advised to collect and refer your Form 16, Form 26AS and bank statements before filing your ITR.\n \nFor FY 20-21, since most Indians could not travel given the pandemic, the government allowed salaried employees to claim a deduction under Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) by spending money through the LTC cash voucher scheme. The tax exemption can be claimed up to a maximum of Rs.36,000 per person or one-third of the expenditure incurred, whichever is less. The money should have been spent purchasing certain goods, which attract a 12% GST rate or higher. The purchases should have been made between 12th October 2020 and 31st March 2021.\nOne of the main ways to be tax compliant is to file your income tax return before the due date. However, this is non-negotiable compliance, and if a taxpayer fails to do so, he gets subjected to penalties under the Income Tax Act. Also, a more important point to note is that while the due date for tax filing has been extended, taxpayers with a self-assessment tax liability of more than Rs.1 lakh will have to pay the same before 31st July 2021. Failing which, the taxpayer will be charged interest beyond 31st July until the date of payment under Sections 234A, 234B and 234C.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "headline": "How Does the G7 Corporate Tax Deal Impact India?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The G7 signed a historic corporate tax agreement last Saturday with regard to the taxation of multinational companies by agreeing to a minimum global tax rate. The G7 is an organisation consisting of seven of the world’s largest economies. It includes the US, the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Italy.\nWhat was decided upon at the G7 meet?\nThere were two major decisions agreed upon with regard to the corporate tax deal, which was introduced to tighten tax loopholes used by multinational companies (MNCs). The first decision was to enable a country to tax the profits earned by the MNC based on the revenues generated in the said country rather than the country where the MNC is located. In other words, the decision results in the MNC being taxed where they operate.\nThe second decision taken was the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. The agreement proposed at the G7 meet will be further discussed in detail at the G20 meet in July between Central Bank governors and finance ministers.\n“We commit to reaching an equitable solution on the allocation of taxing rights, with market countries awarded taxing rights on at least 20% of profit exceeding a 10% margin for the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises.”, said a report by the G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Communiqué. “We also commit to a global minimum tax of at least 15% on a country by country basis. We agree on the importance of progressing agreement in parallel on both pillars and look forward to reaching an agreement at the July meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.”, the report further stated.\nWhich are some of the companies that would get impacted by this deal?\nThe first pillar of the new tax deal could affect over 100 global MNC giants such as Facebook, Alphabet, Nike, Apple, etc. Some of these companies move their headquarters to low-tax jurisdictions to reduce their overall tax revenues. The second pillar of the minimum global corporate tax rate could affect over 8,000 companies that include Amazon and Facebook.\nA report released last November by the Tax Justice Network stated that the US alone loses about $50 billion in tax revenues each year. India loses over $10 billion, and Germany loses over $24 billion due to tax cheats.\nHow will this global corporate tax deal impact countries and India specifically?\nThe corporate tax deal will definitely boost tax revenues for the US and western European nations. However, it could be resisted by countries such as Luxembourg, Hungary, Ireland, Cyprus, and the Caribbean nations, attracting multinationals so far with their low tax rates.\nIndia, however, should not be affected by the global minimum tax rate considering our corporate tax rates stand higher at 22%. India had reduced its corporate tax rates in 2019 from 30% to 22%. Existing domestic companies had to adhere to certain specified conditions, including the condition that they do not avail of any deductions or specified incentives. Besides, existing domestic companies who opt for the concessional tax rates are not required to pay a Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT).\nIndia had also lowered tax rates in 2019 for new domestic manufacturing companies to 15% from 25%. This rate meets the minimum global tax rate as well. India also attracts foreign investments due to the large domestic market available, low-cost labour and its strategic location for exports. \nWould other nations agree to the G7 deal?\nThe G7 agreement could have weightage in G20 discussions. However, this global tax deal could be met with a lot of resistance from countries having lower tax rates, and it could be challenging to reach a consensus. The deal also infringes upon the right of a particular nation to decide upon its tax policy. Experts also argue that the imposition of a minimum global corporate tax rate does not do much to combat tax evasion.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "headline": "Should You Invest in Mid-Cap Funds?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Are you looking for long term growth opportunities? Do you want inflation-beating returns over time? You may consider investing in mid-cap funds. It is an equity fund that puts money mainly in stocks of mid-sized companies that can generate higher returns in the long run. According to the SEBI definition, companies ranked from 101-250 based on market capitalisation are classified as mid-cap companies. Should you invest in mid-cap funds?\nWhat are mid-cap funds?\nMid-cap funds are equity mutual funds that invest predominantly in mid-cap stocks. According to SEBI categorisation, mid-cap funds must invest a minimum of 65% of the total assets in equity and equity-related securities of mid-sized companies. \nYou have the market capitalisation of mid-cap companies ranging from Rs 5,000 crore and less than Rs 20,000 crore. Moreover, mid-cap companies have the potential to become large companies over time. The fund manager selects stocks of medium-sized companies that could perform well over the long run. \nShould you invest in mid-cap funds?\nMid-cap funds invest predominantly in stocks of mid-sized companies. They are suitable mainly for aggressive investors willing to bear a higher risk for market-beating returns over time. You may invest in mid-cap funds to achieve your investment objectives only if you are willing to invest for the long term. \nYou may invest in mid-cap funds only if you can stay with the investment for seven years or more. It is a highly volatile investment for the short and medium-term as it invests in stocks of mid-sized companies. Moreover, these companies are not stable compared to well-established firms with a solid track record of performance. \nYou may avoid mid-cap funds if this is your first time in the stock market. Mid-cap stocks could outperform stocks of more prominent companies during a bull market. However, mid-cap funds are highly vulnerable during a stock market correction. \nIt would help if you added mid-cap funds to your satellite portfolio. They form around 20%-30% of your portfolio and enhance overall portfolio performance. However, you could invest in ETFs, index funds, ELSS and large-cap funds for your core portfolio. \nHow to choose suitable mid-cap funds?\nYou must check the mid-cap fund’s performance compared to the benchmark and peers over three to five years. It helps you gauge the fund performance across different market cycles over time. You may invest in mid-cap funds after checking the track record and the fund manager’s investment style. \nYou may opt for mid-cap funds with a lower expense ratio. It is the cost of managing the mutual fund, and a higher expense ratio could eat up the returns from your investment. However, you must check the track record of the AMC and assets under management (AUM) along with the expense ratio. \nYou must study the portfolio of the mid-cap fund before investing your money. For instance, some mid-cap companies may have underperformed because of corporate governance issues or may not be delivering on their return potential for other reasons. If such companies are part of the mid-cap mutual fund portfolio, it could result in poor performance of the fund. \nYou may consider investing in mid-cap funds through the systematic investment plan or the SIP. It is a facility offered by AMCs where you invest fixed amounts periodically in mutual fund schemes. You can avoid timing the stock market and also average out the purchase costs of units as you stagger your investment across market levels over time. In a nutshell, you must invest in mid-cap funds only if you can invest for the long-term and match your risk profile. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at cleyon.dsouza@cleartax.in\nI write to make complicated financial topics, simple.

        "data": "The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) issued circulars providing relaxation in various compliance requirements of the businesses. The MCA provided extra time for conducting board meetings. It also waived late additional fees for filing statutory forms. \nAs per the Companies Act, 2013, the interval between two board meetings of a company should not exceed 120 days. The company should conduct a minimum of four board meetings in a year. The MCA extended the time between two board meetings by additional 60 days, i.e. interval between two board meetings should not exceed 180 days, in place of 120 days. Thus, a company can now hold two board meetings in a gap of 180 days. \nThe MCA granted relief to companies to file forms reporting the creation or modification of charges on the assets. When the due date of filing Form CHG-1 and Form CHG-9 by a company falls after 1 April 2021 and is expired, it can be filed by 31 May 2021. Form CHG-1 and Form CHG-9 relate to reporting the registration of creation or modification of charge for debentures and registration of creation or modification of charge other than those related to debentures.\nA company that creates a charge on its assets has to register its particulars with the Registrar of Companies. The companies need to register the particulars of the charge with the Registrar within thirty days of its creation. Thus, when a charge is created before 1 April 2021 not yet reported to the Registrar, it can be done by 31 May 2021 without any additional fee.\nThe MCA also waived the additional fee for late filing of various forms under the Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) Act, 2008 and the Companies Act, 2013. The MCA circular stated that the company and LLP could file the statutory forms by 31 July 2021 that are required to be filed between 1 April 2021 and 31 May 2021 without any additional fees. \nThus, the forms due between 1 April 2021 and 31 May 2021 under the Companies Act, 2013 and the LLP Act, 2008 can be filed by 31 July 2021 by paying the regular fees. The MCA provided these relaxations because of the COVID-19 disruption and restrictions. \nThe MCA took these decisions to ease the company and LLP compliances due to the hardships caused during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The MCA received several requests to waive the additional fees on delayed forms due to the COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the government in several parts of India.\nThe MCA examined these requests and took into account the companies’ difficulties due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections and granted extra time till the end of July to file statutory forms without paying any additional fees. The Finance Ministry has also granted relief for various compliance requirements related to GST, Income Tax and customs duty and agricultural cess on medical supplies.\nThe relaxations provided by the MCA will provide relief to the companies and LLP.

        "headline": "How are Flexi-Cap Funds Different From Multi-Cap Funds?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Investing in multi-cap funds was once the best option for those looking to diversify their portfolio with equities of companies across market capitalisation. The fund managers of multi-cap funds had the liberty to modify the fund’s asset allocation depending on the market developments and trends.\nThe fund managers could increase allocation towards a particular capitalisation to any extent. However, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) recently took away this flexibility by introducing flexi-cap funds. Multi-cap and flexi-cap funds may look similar, but there are a few stark differences between the two. \nAs per the guidelines of SEBI, a multi-cap fund should have a mandatory allocation of 25% towards each of large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks. The asset allocation to equities of each capitalisation cannot drop below 25% at any time. Depending on the market developments, the exposure towards any capitalisation can go up to 50%. \nEarlier, multi-cap funds did not have an allocation of 25% towards small-cap securities. The increased exposure to small-cap securities translated into investing in multi-cap funds unsuitable for risk-averse investors as their exposure to small-cap equities could go up to 50%. \nThe SEBI asked fund houses to comply with the new guidelines by making changes in the asset allocation of their multi-cap funds. If the fund houses wanted to continue following the old guidelines, they had to rename their multi-cap funds as ‘flexi-cap funds’. All fund houses (except two) opted to follow the old norms by renaming their schemes.\nFlexi-cap funds invest in equities of companies across capitalisation with no fixed allocation towards any. The fund manager has the leeway to change the asset allocation depending on the markets. If you are worried about the high exposure of multi-cap funds towards small-cap, investing in flexi-cap funds is the right option for you. \nThe asset allocation of flexi-cap funds is mostly made towards large-cap stocks, giving you much-needed stability. The exposure towards mid and small-cap funds is not significant compared to large-cap, but enough to amplify your returns during a bullish market. \nThe following table shows the major differences between flexi-cap and multi-cap funds:\nThe current market scenario calls for investors to take caution. Given the market volatility, it would be best to invest in flexi-cap funds as the fund manager has the liberty to modify the fund’s portfolio depending on the trend. Also, higher exposure to large-cap stocks gives you stability, which may not be available with multi-cap funds as they invest a good sum of money in small-cap stocks. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at vineeth.nc@cleartax.in\nEngineer by qualification, financial writer by choice.

Moreover, you could invest in global funds that invest in a portfolio of stocks from across the world. It helps as if one of the stock markets doesn’t perform well, the other markets make up. \nShould you have international exposure in your investment portfolio?\nYou can invest in international funds for geographical diversification.

        "headline": "Should You Invest in Balanced Advantage Funds? Get Your Answer Here",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Are you looking for a dynamically managed investment? Do you want an investment in both equity and debt securities? You may consider putting your money in balanced advantage funds. It is a mutual fund that dynamically shifts between equity, derivatives and debt instruments based on market conditions. AMFI data shows net inflows of Rs 2,711 crore in balanced advantage funds in March 2021 compared to Rs 2,005 crore in February. You could diversify your portfolio with balanced advantage funds if you are a first-time investor in the stock market. Should you invest in balanced advantage funds?\nWhat are balanced advantage funds?\nYou have balanced advantage funds, also called dynamic asset allocation funds, as a category of mutual funds introduced by SEBI, the capital market regulator, in October 2017. It is a dynamically managed investment that puts your money in a mix of stocks and fixed income instruments.  \nYou have the fund manager changing the asset allocation depending on market conditions to generate an optimum return with minimum risk for the investors. \nFor instance, the fund manager of the balanced advantage fund will reduce exposure to equities when stock markets peak and shift funds into debt securities. You would find the profits remaining intact, even if the stock markets correct or crash in a short time.\nShould you invest in balanced advantage funds?\nYou may consider investing in balanced advantage funds only if you have a time horizon of at least three years. It balances holdings between equity and debt securities depending on market conditions to earn reasonable returns with low volatility as compared to pure equity funds. You can invest in balanced advantage funds if this is your first time in the stock market. \nYou must invest in balanced advantage funds if you want to diversify your portfolio against the pandemic-induced volatility of the stock market. The fund manager uses model-based triggers to adjust allocations depending on market conditions, without an upper or lower cap on the exposure to equity and debt instruments. It helps you earn risk-adjusted returns and attain long term financial goals. \nYou can invest in balanced advantage funds if you want to avoid timing the stock market. For instance, balanced advantage funds increased exposure to equity instruments when the stock markets crashed in March 2020 due to the coronavirus lockdown. However, it earned high returns on the investment when the markets bounced back due to the economic recovery post-lockdown. You find automatic asset allocation protecting you from the volatility of the stock market. \nYou may consider investing in balanced advantage funds through the systematic investment plan or the SIP. It is a facility offered by AMCs that helps you invest small amounts of money regularly in a mutual fund scheme. You get the rupee cost averaging benefit, which helps you average out the investment cost over time.\nYou can invest in balanced advantage funds if you seek a higher return than fixed income instruments. For instance, lower interest rates in the economy mean you could struggle to get an inflation-beating return from bank fixed deposits. \nIt would help if you invested in balanced advantage funds as the equity allocation may ensure an inflation-beating return over some time. However, you must invest in balanced advantage funds only if it matches your investment objectives and risk tolerance. \nTaxation of balanced advantage funds\nYou have balanced advantage funds taxed similarly as equity-oriented funds. It invests in equity, debt and arbitrage in one portfolio. The arbitrage portion of the portfolio works on the mispricing between equity shares in the spot and futures market. \nYou will find the arbitrage component taking advantage of the price differentials between current and future securities to generate higher returns in a rising, falling and flat stock market.\nYou have balanced advantage funds with at least 65% of the corpus in equity and equity-related instruments taxed as equity-oriented funds. It means long term capital gains, LTCG above Rs 1 lakh per financial year, are taxed at 10% without the indexation benefit. However, if the equity allocation goes below 65% in balanced advantage funds, the remaining allocation in derivative securities helps it qualify for the tax benefits of equity-oriented funds. \nHow to pick suitable balanced advantage funds?\nAre balanced advantage funds better than balanced funds?\nYou have balanced advantage funds as a multi-dimensional investment when compared to balanced funds. For instance, balanced advantage funds may reduce equity allocation to around 30% when stock markets peak. Balanced funds have a narrow allocation band and don’t offer sufficient protection to your portfolio during overvalued stock markets.\nYou may find balanced advantage funds as a better investment option than balanced funds for undervalued stock markets. For example, it can increase equity exposure to around 80% when stock markets correct and generate significant returns over some time. However, a balanced fund cannot match the equity exposure of a balanced advantage fund during undervalued stock markets. \nYou have balanced advantage funds performing even when stock markets are flat. It has an arbitrage component that takes advantage of the price difference in equity shares between the spot and the futures market. However, balanced funds cannot match this performance as they invest mainly in equity and debt securities. \nYou may invest in balanced advantage funds if you seek a higher return than a bank fixed deposit. It is a tax-efficient investment for those in the highest income tax brackets. It is suitable for first-time investors in stocks and can be a part of your core portfolio.

        "headline": "Real-time reports to aid GST officers in identifying vehicles moving without e-way bills",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The government is devising a system that will soon provide real-time reports to GST officers about those vehicles moving without e-way bills. It helps intercept trucks stuck at toll booths and also monitor GST evasion. It is called the ‘Real-time and Analysis Reports on RFID’ report to assist GST officers in catching tax evaders who misuse the e-way bill system. Even with the e-invoicing system introduced for large taxpayers, the e-way bill must be generated and cannot get substituted with an e-invoice.\nTax officers will also receive analytical reports to identify e-way bills creation without any movement of goods. It will aid officials in detecting cases of circular trading. It would also include information on the recycling of e-way bills for tax evasion-prone goods. It will assist officers in recognising tax evaders. Circular trading refers to a fraudulent activity where a GST registered person issues invoices without actual movement of goods. The intention is to pass on the illicit input tax credit along the supply chain.\ne-Way bills are compulsory for inter-state transportation of goods valued over Rs.50,000 under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) law from April 2018. Gold, on the other hand, is excluded. Suppliers and transporters who use the e-way bill system must produce it if asked by a GST inspector at the check posts across India.\nThe government mentioned in a report titled “e-Way Bill – A Three-Year Journey” that about 180 crore e-way bills were generated in three years until March 2021. Tax officials picked up just 7 crore e-way bills for verification.\n61.68 crore e-way bills were produced in the FY 2020-21, which ended in March 2021, of which 2.27 crore were picked up for verification. In the FY 2019-20, which ended in March 2020, 62.88 crore e-way bills were produced, with 3.01 crore being picked up by tax officers for verification. Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka were the top five states that produced most of the e-way bills for transporting inter-state goods.\nTextiles, electrical machinery, machinery and mechanical equipment, iron and steel, and automobiles are the top five industries that have produced the highest number of e-way bills in the last three years.\nThe government has integrated RFID/FASTag with the e-way bill system as of 1st January 2021. Every transporter must have an RFID tag in his vehicle, with details of the e-way bill created for goods being transported by the vehicle being uploaded into the RFID. When a vehicle passes through an RFID Tag reader on a highway, the information entered into the system is posted to the government’s website.\nRevenue officials then use the details to verify the supplies made by a GST-registered taxpayer. The government has begun blocking the generation of e-way bills if a GST registered taxpayer has not filed a GSTR-3B return for two months in a row. The move helps in boosting tax compliance in India.\nThe government has also made it impossible to generate more than one e-way bill on a single invoice. Suppose an e-way bill is generated once with an invoice number or document number. In that case, no one else can create another e-way bill with the same invoice number. It is similar to the e-invoicing system.\nFurthermore, the e-way bill’s method now allows for distance calculation based on PIN codes. Based on PIN codes, the device can automatically determine the distance between the source and destination. The government will have a real-time report on vehicle movement for selected e-way bills in the coming future. It will aid officers in understanding the vehicle’s trail of movement.\nOfficers will also have access to a real-time database on vehicles travelling without e-way bills for a specific toll booth, allowing them to intercept only those that do not have e-way bills.\nFurther, the e-invoicing system has led to integration between the e-way bill and the e-invoicing system. Therefore, the notified taxpayers must be cautious of data inputs into the e-invoicing system as the e-way bills get auto-generated at the taxpayer’s option. Going forward, the e-invoicing system might be extended to most businesses, including small taxpayers as well. Hence, it is crucial to configure existing ERP systems to align with the format of e-invoice while also keeping the relevant fields necessary for e-way bills for smooth operations.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at  annapoorna.m@cleartax.in\nAnnapoorna, popularly known as Anna, is an aspiring Chartered Accountant with a flair for GST.

        "headline": "5 Things to Look For While Choosing an e-Invoicing Solution For Your Business",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Phase three of e-invoicing rolled out to businesses with a turnover of more than Rs.50 crore on 1st April 2021. Several lakh businesses in India have further adopted this digital reform, in line with the government’s aim of bringing ease and transparency in tax reporting. These electronic machine-readable invoices will help the interworking between the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system and the e-way bill system, preventing tax evasion and fraud. \nTo break down e-invoicing, it is the generation of tax invoices on the taxpayer’s accounting system and reporting them to the Invoice Registration Portal (IRP) hosted by the government. The invoice data gets uploaded to the IRP directly from the taxpayer’s accounting system or ERP or by using an Excel-based offline tool. The IRP validates this data and generates a unique invoice reference number (IRN) and a QR code before digitally signing the invoice. This validated, and digitally signed invoice is called an e-invoice.\nThe IRP then sends this e-invoice data to the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) and the e-way bill portal. The supplier’s GSTR-1 return gets auto-populated from this e-invoice data, and the buyer’s GSTR-2A/2B/4A and 6A returns, as applicable, get further auto-populated. This entire process not just saves taxpayers’ efforts in data reporting but also streamlines business processes in terms of automated data flows, faster ITC claims, real-time tracking of invoices, etc. \nNow, every business in India whose turnover exceeds Rs.50 crore, if eligible for e-invoicing, is looking to purchase a good, value-for-money e-invoicing solution for their business. While using the offline tool is an option, it is extremely time-consuming and requires manual effort, making it prone to errors. Hence, most businesses are opting for an automated solution that enables them to generate e-invoices without leaving the comfort of their current accounting software. \nIf you’re looking for a solution to generate e-invoices automatically while continuing to use your existing accounting software, then these are the things you should keep in mind while choosing an e-invoicing solution.\n1. Bulk e-invoice generation and cancellation\nIn our present fast-paced world, no one wants to wait to generate e-invoices one at a time. Hence, find an e-invoicing solution that offers bulk e-invoice generation and cancellation directly through your ERP system. \nA pro tip here is to check if your e-invoicing solution also offers data bifurcation, i.e., classification of transactions as B2B, B2C, exports, e-commerce supplies, reverse-charge supplies, etc. Also, a bifurcation of data based on e-invoices applicable for e-way bill generation and those that are not is a must. This way, you can sit back and relax while your e-invoicing solution generates thousands of e-invoices at a time, with no effort required from your end.\n2. Error-handling and reliability \nThere are just a few e-invoicing solutions that guarantee error-free e-invoices. This is because they have government-compatible APIs and an error-correction mechanism built into the solution. These data validations will verify the data and send the request only if the data is accurate. Hence, you can rest assured that your e-invoices are error-free. \nAlso, find an e-invoicing solution that offers zero downtime for uninterrupted e-invoice generation. You definitely do not want your customers to suffer due to a lag on your solution provider’s part.\n3. 24×7 customer support\nLet’s face it. e-Invoicing is a new reform, and the implementation of most new reforms is stressful. You could always be in a situation where your client urgently needs an e-invoice to be generated, but due to some reason, you are unable to generate the same. Also, as you know, the GST and e-way bill system are integrated with the e-invoicing system. Hence, there could be issues of data not getting reflected in the GST returns or issues with e-way bill generation, etc., that could crop up at any point in time. This is why 24×7 customer support is of utmost importance.\n4. 100% data security \ne-Invoicing is an integrated process through an organisation’s ERP, which also contains vital financial information. Hence, data security is one factor that cannot be compromised at all. You must ensure that your service provider has two-factor authentication enabled, has IP whitelisting done, has advanced user access management with access control depending on the type of user, and is ISO 27001 certified.\n5. A comprehensive solution\nLook for a service provider that offers an e-invoicing solution and an integrated solution that includes GST return filing and e-way bill generation. Otherwise, you could end up wasting a lot of time working with different software and coordinating with different vendors, while overall, paying a lot more money. \nAlso, check if your solution provider is offering data reconciliations and MIS reports. This will help your business gain insights from the data, which will further help managerial decision making. Data reconciliations also help accurate data reporting in the GST returns and avoid the tax department’s notices.\nKeeping these important factors in mind while choosing the right e-invoicing solution, you can now help get your business e-invoicing-compliant in no time!\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "data": "The Indian Rupee has hit a 9-month low, i.e. 75.4, against the US Dollar on 13 April 2021. The currency has lost 4.2% over the last three weeks, one of the biggest losses among the emerging market currencies. The sharp rise in the COVID-19 cases in the country is to be attributed to the pressure and the loss the Indian Rupee had to bear. \nAnother important factor for the fall would be the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) announcement that it’ll maintain the fairly accommodative monetary policy and inject liquidity into the economy through the Government Securities Acquisition Programme (G-SAP). RBI is planning to start the programme with Rs.1 lakh crore in the current quarter. \nConcerns regarding economic recovery and normalisation have been growing like never before, resulting in the Rupee taking the hit. \nAnalysing the fall\nOn 22 March, the Rupee traded at 72.38 to USD and slipped its stand to 75.42 on 13 April. This slip in the value witnessed a decline of 4.2% in a matter of three weeks. On 13 April alone, the Rupee lost 43 paise to the US Dollar, proving to be the weakest emerging market currency over the three weeks. \nOn the other hand, only the Turkish New Lira lost more than Indian Rupee during the period. It declined 4.36% against the US Dollar. Brazilian Real, Russian Ruble, Thai Baht, and Indonesian Rupiah have lost 3.99%, 3.25%, 2.33%, and 1.5% respectively in the same period.\nCauses of the decline in value\nHow’s the future going to be?\nIndustry experts think that the Rupee may go up to 77-78 over the next few months. This can raise concern among importers and individuals who have planned expenses in foreign currencies.

        "data": "The GST Network (GSTN) has issued a new clarification on 12th April 2021 over the HSN code reporting. Specific HSN codes are not made available in the HSN master or not being accepted on e-invoice and e-way bill portals.\nThe release clarified that the notifications on the mandatory HSN code reporting being Central Tax Notification no. 78/2020 was the minimum requirement on the invoice. In other words, the taxpayers must declare at least four digits or six digits of the HSN code mandatorily depending upon the turnover category they fall into and the type of invoice. \nFor instance, an invoice requires a six-digit HSN code that the taxpayer must report. Then the taxpayer can report either six digits or eight digits of the HSN code as may be available in the Tariff. On the other hand, where the taxpayer must report four digits of the HSN code in the invoice, he has three options. He can report four digits or six digits, or eight digits of the HSN code is available in the Tariff.\nHowever, suppose the minimum stipulated four or six digits of the HSN code is not available in the tariff. In that case, it is not allowed to be mentioned in the invoice. Further, there is usually no mention of the specific description, unit, and GST rate in such cases.\nIt was noticed that some taxpayers are reporting a truncated HSN code containing only the first six digits instead of the total of eight digits. They are not present in the Tariff at a six-digit level. Further, these do not have a corresponding description given and leaves it invalid. Therefore, the system is rejecting such HSN code inputs. \nThe GSTN further asked taxpayers to raise tickets for any queries or validation failures on the GST portal or e-invoice portal, or the e-way bill portal. They must use the GST self-service portal available at https://selfservice.gstsystem.in/. Upon visiting the portal, the aggrieved taxpayer must navigate the ‘Report Issue’ section and type ‘HSN’ in the search box known as ‘Type of Issue/Concern’. After that, he must select the applicable sub-type as ‘e-Invoice – IRP – HSN Code related’. \nThe mandatory reporting of HSN codes was introduced while preparing the GSTR-1 return from 1st April 2021. As per the revised declaration, taxpayers with an annual aggregate turnover of more than Rs.5 crore must mandatorily declare six digits of the HSN code on all the tax invoices. The turnover to consider must be of the previous financial year. For instance, to report an invoice in FY 2021-22, one must consider the turnover of FY 2020-21.\nThose taxpayers having an annual turnover of equal to or less than Rs.5 crore must report four digits of the HSN code on all the Business-to-Business (B2B) invoices. Simultaneously, this rule of minimum reporting is made optional on Business-to-Customers (B2C) invoices.\nThe Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has already issued the corresponding notifications on 15th October 2020. The Central Tax notification number 78/2020 deals with the HSN code’s length to be reported from 1st April 2021. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at annapoorna.m@cleartax.in\nAnnapoorna, popularly known as Anna, is an aspiring Chartered Accountant with a flair for GST.

        "headline": "Should You Invest in Multi-Asset Funds?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Do you want to diversify your investments? Are you looking at a steady return while managing risk in your portfolio? You may consider investing in multi-asset funds. It is a mutual fund that invests your money across multiple asset classes such as equities, debt, gold and international equities. You may diversify your portfolio across asset classes to mitigate risk and earn steady returns across market cycles. Should you invest in multi-asset funds?\nWhat are multi-asset funds?\nMulti-asset funds are hybrid mutual fund schemes that invest the corpus in varied asset classes such as equities, debt, commodities and even International equities. According to SEBI rules, it invests in a minimum of three asset classes with at least a minimum allocation of 10% each in all three asset classes.\nYou have the multi-asset fund manager looking to minimise portfolio volatility while improving the investors’ risk-adjusted return. Studies have shown that one particular asset class cannot outperform all other asset classes all the time. There isn’t a single asset class that has performed well in all the years. \nFor example, equities may have topped the return charts in one particular year, and gold may have outperformed other asset classes at a different time. \nShould you invest in multi-asset funds?\nIf you invest in a mutual fund that spreads your investment across multiple asset classes, it protects you against the failure of one asset class. For instance, if equity investments are underperforming, the portfolio’s debt component could make up for it. \nMoreover, if both equity and debt are not doing well, then probably the gold portion of the portfolio may come to the rescue. \nOne of the critical benefits of multi-asset funds is portfolio rebalancing in a tax-efficient manner. The fund manager focuses on automatic disciplined rebalancing to mitigate risk and ensure a steady return. \nHow to pick the right multi-asset fund?\nYou may consider choosing a multi-asset fund from an asset management company (AMC) with significant assets under management (AUM). It could bear sudden redemption pressure by substantial investors.\nYou must check the mutual fund house’s track record and the fund manager’s investment style before investing in the multi-asset fund. It is vital as the fund manager takes the call when it comes to the proper asset allocation.\nYou have multi-asset funds taxed similar to equity or debt funds depending on the equity allocation. For example, you have a multi-asset fund that invests at least 65% in equity and equity-related instruments, taxed as an equity-oriented fund. However, irrespective of whether they are equity or debt-oriented, multi-asset funds are still tax-efficient compared to bank fixed deposits. \nYou may invest in multi-asset funds only if you can stay with the investment for the long term. It is less risky than most hybrid funds as it invests in a minimum of three asset classes. Moreover, it also invests in International equities that are negatively correlated with the Indian stock market. In simple terms, International equities can protect your investment against the volatility of India’s stock markets.

        "headline": "QRMP scheme compliance under GST for March 2021",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The GST Network (GSTN) has released an advisory for all the taxpayers required to comply with the QRMP scheme for March 2021. Considering the newness of the scheme, the government has issued the advisory dated 8th April 2021. These taxpayers are complying with it for the first time for the January-March 2021 quarter. \nThe third month of the quarter’s compliance differs slightly from the first two months of the quarter. The GST returns in forms GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B must be filed in April 2021 for the January-March 2021 quarter. Hence, the consolidated details must be submitted for the entire quarter by the due dates lined up in April 2021. In contrast, the tax payments must take place regularly every month. \nThe advisory detailed the timelines for tax payments by the taxpayers under the QRMP scheme for all three months of a quarter. For the first two months of the quarter, these taxpayers must pay tax through a challan known as PMT-06 by the 25th of the following month. While this challan is generated on the GST portal, taxpayers must select “Monthly payment for the quarterly taxpayer” as the reason for challan generation.\nThe tax computation for the first two months also varied from the third month of the quarter. The taxpayers can choose either of the two methods prescribed by the law. The advisory affirms that these options are only available for the first two months of the quarter. \nUnder the first method, popularly called the “35% challan” method or “Fixed Sum” method, a pre-filled challan gets generated. It contains a challan amount equivalent to 35% of tax paid by cash for the previous quarter, provided it was a quarterly return. However, if the preceding return happened to be filed monthly, then the challan amount auto-computed is 100% of tax paid for that previous month, preceding the relevant quarter.\nUnder the second method known as the “Self-assessment” method, the taxpayers must compute tax liability for that relevant month. It is done by considering the tax payable on outward supplies or sales and reducing the tax paid on inward supplies or purchases for every tax head such as CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess.\nNote that if the cash balance in the electronic cash ledger is sufficient to clear off the liability as per challan, then the taxpayer need not separately deposit cash. \nOn the other hand, the tax calculation for the last month of the quarter is entirely different. For instance, the tax to be arrived at for March 2021 of the January-March 2021 quarter will be purely based on values declared in form GSTR-3B for the quarter. It will take into account the tax payments done for the first two months of the same quarter. Any shortfall of payment that got spilt over to the last month must be paid along with the challan for the third month of that quarter. The taxpayers must fill up the details in quarterly form GSTR-3B, click on the “Create Challan” button in payment table 6 of GSTR-3B, file the PMT-06 challan while depositing the tax amount due. \nThe due date of tax payment for the third month is either the 22nd or 24th of the month following the quarter, i.e., 22nd or 24th April for the January-March 2021 quarter. It is the same as the due date for filing quarterly GSTR-3B.\nThe government has earlier issued various advisories to ensure that the taxpayers can smoothly comply with the scheme’s rules. These taxpayers have already been allowed to declare their invoices raised on B2B outward supplies for January and February 2021 through the Invoice Furnishing Facility (IFF).\nThe invoices so declared shall get auto-populated into the quarterly GSTR-1 due by 11th April 2021 for January-March 2021 quarter. Although this reduces manual efforts to some extent, there is also a relative amount of reconciliation involved while filing GSTR-1 to ensure no duplicates and omissions in invoice reporting. Hence, taxpayers must be cautious while filing the quarterly GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B to consolidate details of all three months of the January-March 2021 quarter.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at annapoorna.m@cleartax.in\nAnnapoorna, popularly known as Anna, is an aspiring Chartered Accountant with a flair for GST.

        "headline": "Critical Lessons for Investors From the Archegos Collapse",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Do you want to borrow and invest in the stock market? Are you looking to trade in stocks rather than invest for the long run? You may consider these critical lessons for investors from the Archegos collapse before trading in the stock market. Archegos Capital Management is a New York-based family investment vehicle owned by Bill Hwang, a hedge fund legend Julian Robertson. You may find Archegos focusing on public stocks in the US, Europe, South Korea, China and Japan. It was estimated to have managed around $10 billion of its own money.\nBill Hwang was the founder of Tiger Asia, one of the biggest Asia-focused hedge funds, in 2001. However, the firm pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges in 2012 for profiting from securities trades using inside information from large investment banks. Bill Hwang converted Tiger Asia into his family office and renamed it Archegos. You have Archegos Capital Management at the centre of a storm with the huge fire sale of stocks worth more than $20 billion last month. It has led to the wiping out of billions of dollars from US and Chinese stocks. What are the critical lessons for investors from the Archegos collapse?\nWhat caused the Archegos collapse?\nYou must understand the term ‘leverage’ before you focus on the Archegos collapse. In simple terms, leverage means using borrowed money to maximise the potential return from an investment. You will find many traders in the stock market using leverage to increase the return from trading in stocks. \nLeverage is a facility that helps you increase your trading position beyond your cash balance alone as the broker provides borrowed funds. You have to make a deposit called the margin, which increases exposure to an underlying asset. In simple terms, you put down a fraction of your trade’s total value and your broker loans you the rest of the amount. However, leveraging or using borrowed funds to trade in the stock market can amplify both your profits and losses. \nYou could lay the blame for the Archegos crisis at the doorstep of a financial derivative instrument called a total return swap. It is a contract that permits a user to take on the profits and losses of a stock portfolio or any other asset in exchange for a fee. You have one of the parties making payments depending on a set rate, and the counterparty also making payments based on the return from an underlying asset. For instance, if the underlying asset is a basket of stocks, payments are made depending on the income (share dividends) and capital gains (appreciation in the share price). \nArchegos used total return swaps to borrow money from top investment banks and made them purchase a basket of stocks. It paid banks a pre-decided fixed fee at uniform intervals and the interest cost on the borrowed funds. In return, you would find the investment banks paying Archegos the capital gains on the stock portfolio and dividends at pre-defined intervals. \nYou would find top investment banks such as Nomura, Credit Suisse, and others buying shares on behalf of Archegos in return for a lucrative fee. Moreover, banks agreed to pay Archegos the capital appreciation from shares and dividends if it actually owned the shares. For instance, if the share prices went up or dividends were paid, you have the investment banks paying a return to Archegos. However, if the share prices crashed (investment failed), Archegos would have to pay the investment banks.\nArchegos had total return swap agreements with many investment banks on the same set of stocks. However, the investment banks were not aware of this. It helped Archegos borrow heavily without having the requisite capital to fall back on. You have many investment banks attracted by such services’ hefty fees, turning a blind eye as Archegos amplified its buying power, sometimes by around eight times its capital. \nYou have Archegos reaping massive profits as long as the stocks in the swap portfolio kept rising. However, Archegos faced problems after the share prices of ViacomCBS and other top stocks purchased on its behalf started falling. Investment banks made a margin call asking Archegos to put up additional collateral, which they could not do. The banks had no choice but to dump the stocks to minimise their losses leading to a further fall in the share prices.\nThe Archegos collapse could cost top investment banks billions of dollars in losses. Moreover, Bill Hwang, the owner of Archegos, lost around $8 billion in just 10 days. You would find the Archegos collapse sparking calls for the greater scrutiny of family offices that manage the wealth of rich individuals worldwide. The Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC, the securities regulator in the US, doesn’t regulate family offices. Moreover, SEBI, the capital market regulator in India, also doesn’t regulate India’s family offices. \nCritical lessons for investors from the Archegos collapse\nYou may avoid trading in stocks and focus on long term investments in equity funds if it matches your risk profile. However, it would help if you did not touch financial instruments you don’t fully understand. It will help if you don’t borrow and invest in stocks. The Archegos crisis has shown you that leverage can be highly destructive. Moreover, you must avoid concentrated investments if you are a beginner in the stock market. In a nutshell, invest in equity mutual funds for the long run rather than trade in shares for the short term. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at cleyon.dsouza@cleartax.in\nI write to make complicated financial topics, simple.

        "headline": "What is tax-loss harvesting? Does it help to reduce capital gain taxes?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Are you an active investor or a trader in the stock market? Then you would have heard the term tax-loss harvesting. If not, then let us take you through what it means.\nThe financial year is at its ending. Those who invested in the fall of March 2020 would have booked enormous gains. As the stock market has gone up by almost 90% since the onset of the pandemic in the last year. \nWhat is tax-loss harvesting?\nWhen you start investing, the main aim is to earn money from your investments. But one has to embrace the reality that if some stocks perform well in a well-diversified portfolio, few of them do not even provide a break-even.\nTax-loss harvesting is a tool used by the traders/investors by selling off the securities with negative returns at a loss to offset the capital gain tax liability. Tax-loss harvesting is also known as “tax-loss selling.” Usually, this strategy is implemented near the end of the financial year, but you can harvest your losses at any time in a particular financial year to reap the benefits. Although tax-loss harvesting cannot restore an investor to their previous position, it can reduce the loss’s severity. For example, a loss in Security X’s value could be sold to offset the increase in Security Y’s price, thus eliminating the capital gain tax liability of Security Y.\nThis method is mainly used for short-term capital gains as they are taxed at slightly higher rates than long-term gains. However, you can also use this strategy for long-term gains. \nWhen an investor sells an investment for profit, the gains are either long term or short term. Any investment held for more than a year is considered a long-term gain, and less than a year will result in short-term gains. Long-term investments attract LTCG tax at 10 per cent above Rs 1 lakh, whereas short-term investments are taxed at 15%.\nTax-loss harvesting is a strategy that can be used to turn off a portion of capital losses into tax offsets to reduce the outflow of capital gain tax. When you sell off some of your investments at a loss to offset the gains realized on other stocks, by doing this, you have to pay taxes on net gains only. \nInvestors can proceed by selling off the floundering investments in return to purchase an asset with similar nature to maintain the portfolio allocation.  \nOne has to keep in mind that if you wish to harvest losses and offset them against gains, the entire sale transaction should be completed within the financial year, i.e. before 31st March.\nWhile harvesting helps to reduce the tax liability on the capital gains of the particular financial year, the Income Tax Act allows you to carry forward the capital losses for eight consecutive years. This provision can help you harvest the losses of the investments whose chances of improvement are bleak shortly. For such investments, you can book losses and can carry forward them for offsetting against future capital gains.\nHow to calculate the losses?\nIf you have made a lump-sum purchase of an investment, then calculating gains and losses is a simple task. The difference between purchase and sales of the stocks will give you the number of capital gains or losses. However, if the investment you wish to harvest was invested through SIP mode, then its record keeping is a challenge. You will have to get the details of each purchase’s date and value to calculate the holding period and gains/losses separately for each SIP transaction.  \nExample of Tax-Loss Harvesting\nAssume Mr Ankur is an investor with the below-mentioned portfolio:\nPortfolio:\nTrading Activity:\nWithout tax-loss harvesting, the tax liability from this activity is:\nThe investor harvested losses by selling mutual funds Y and Z, which helps to offset the gains, and the tax liability would be:\nTax with harvesting = ((Rs.300,000 – Rs130,000 – Rs.1,00,000)) x 10%) + ((Rs.150,000 – 100,000) x 15%) = Rs. 7000 + Rs.7,500 = Rs.14,500\nThus, by harvesting losses of mutual funds Y and Z, the tax liability can be reduced from Rs.42,500 to Rs. 14,500, i.e. Rs.28000 can be saved on capital gain taxes. Using the tax-loss harvesting strategy, investors can realise significant tax savings. However, they should be cautious that only those stocks which have a long-term negative impact and little chance of improvement should be harvested.  \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at jyoti.arora@cleartax.in\nI am a Chartered Accountant by profession with  4+ years of experience in the finance domain.

        "headline": "Should You Invest in Target Maturity Funds to Beat Inflation?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Are you looking for an inflation-beating return without investing in the stock market? Do you seek investment for the long-term? You may consider investing in target maturity funds. It is a debt mutual fund scheme that puts your money in bonds that mature in four to seven years. You have retail inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), jumping to 5.03% in February because of rising food and energy prices. It helps if you invest your money in a financial instrument that may offer an inflation-beating return over some time. Should you invest in target maturity funds to beat inflation?\nWhat are the target maturity funds?\nYou may consider target maturity funds as debt mutual fund schemes that invest in bonds of a high credit quality with a defined maturity period ranging from four to seven years. It is a passive investment in bonds of similar maturity constituting the benchmark index of the fund. \nIt invests in G-Secs (Government of India bonds), state government bonds, corporate bonds or a combination of these bonds, matching the benchmark index. \nYou may consider target maturity funds as a relatively safe investment. It puts your money in G-Secs or state government bonds that have a sovereign guarantee. You will find these bonds having no default risk, which makes them a safe investment. Moreover, target maturity funds also invest in AAA-rated bonds of public sector entities that enjoy government backing. \nShould you invest in target maturity funds?\nYou could invest in target maturity funds if you seek a fixed income investment. It helps if you have a time horizon that matches the maturity date of these funds. For example, you can invest in target maturity funds if you have a time horizon of four to seven years. \nYou must invest in target maturity funds only if you can stay with the investment until maturity. Moreover, you get the returns indicated at the time of investing in the fund. It would help if you invested in target maturity funds whose bond yields have risen and stay invested up to maturity. \nInvest in target maturity funds if you seek minimum credit risk as compared to many other debt funds. It puts your money in sovereign government bonds and AAA-rated PSU bonds. \nYou may invest in target maturity funds compared to bank fixed deposits if you fall in the higher income tax brackets. After holding the target maturity fund for three or more years, you have long-term capital gains taxed at 20% with the indexation benefit. It is a tax-efficient investment than bank FDs and post office fixed deposits. \nAre target maturity funds the same as FMPs?\nYou have most fixed maturity plans or FMPs having a maturity period ranging from one to three years. It is a closed-end debt mutual fund scheme with a fixed maturity period. You may invest in FMPs only during the NFO (New Fund Offer) and redeem the investment on maturity. \nYou have target maturity funds as open-ended debt mutual fund schemes that offer better liquidity than FMPs. It would invest in bonds that constitute a particular index and have flexible tenure compared to fixed maturity plans. \nWhat are the disadvantages of investing in target maturity funds?\nYou will find target maturity funds vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations in the economy. It invests in bonds of longer duration that makes it susceptible to interest rate risk. You may invest in target maturity funds only if you can stay with the investment until maturity. \nYou may consider investing in target maturity funds if you are a long-term investor seeking a fixed income investment. Moreover, it has the potential to offer an inflation-beating return over some time. It will help if you invest in these funds to achieve your financial goals based on your risk profile.

        "headline": "Why Are Perpetual Bonds Trending Lately?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "You have banks marketing perpetual bonds as a suitable investment for retirees seeking regular income. It offers a considerably higher rate of interest than bank fixed deposits. For instance, SBI provides a much higher interest rate on perpetual bonds than around 5.4% for bank fixed deposits of maturity ranging from 5-10 years. However, is investing in perpetual bonds of banks and NBFCs the same as putting money in their fixed deposits? \nWhat are perpetual bonds?\nYou may consider a typical bond as having a fixed maturity tenure. However, perpetual bonds have no maturity date. You have these bonds capable of going on for as long as the issuer remains a going concern. It means the company remains stable and continues with the business for the foreseeable future. \nHowever, these perpetual bonds have a ‘call’ option that allows the issuer to redeem the bond at a fixed price and date. Many issuers use the call option for the early redemption of perpetual bonds. For instance, the call option allows the issuer to buy back the bond after a specific period, such as five years. \nYou have banks issuing AT-1 or Additional Tier 1 bonds, a type of perpetual bond to meet Basel III capital norms. It ensures that banks have a buffer of high-quality liquid assets to manage cash outflows during periods of short-term stress. In simple terms, it helps banks maintain strong balance sheets. However, it is an unsecured instrument being senior only to common equity.\nYou would find investors putting money in AT-1 bonds to earn a higher return than bank fixed deposits. However, SEBI has tightened regulations around these bonds. It allows only institutional investors to subscribe to these bonds with a minimum trading lot size and a minimum allotment size of Rs 1 crore. You will find many retail investors picking already traded AT-1 bonds from the secondary market on recommendation from relationship managers and brokers. \nWhy do banks issue perpetual bonds?\nYou have many investors believing that perpetual bonds enjoy the guaranteed return of bank fixed deposits. However, banks issue perpetual bonds such as AT-1 to meet capital adequacy norms. Banks have the freedom to write off the principal and not pay interest on these bonds if they face bankruptcy. \nYou may find banks that issue AT-1 bonds skipping the interest payouts for a particular year if capital ratios fall below specific threshold levels, as mentioned in their offer terms.\nMoreover, RBI could ask banks to cancel the outstanding additional tier 1 bonds if they feel the bank needs to be rescued even without consulting the investors in perpetual bonds. For instance, RBI allowed Yes Bank to completely write-off AT-1 bonds as bondholders who invested around Rs 10,800 crore suffered a massive loss. \nShould senior citizens invest in perpetual bonds?\nYou have senior citizens subscribing to banks’ perpetual bonds to earn a higher return than bank fixed deposits. You may also find depositors in bank FDs insured up to Rs 5 lakhs for both principal and interest amounts in a particular bank. However, perpetual bondholders have no such guarantee even if the bank issues the bonds. \nBanks can skip interest payouts partly or wholly on AT-1 bonds if their capital falls below a regulatory requirement. Moreover, your principal amount itself is at risk if banks face severe financial pressure. However, you will never find banks defaulting on fixed deposits of investors. \nIf you invest in a bank FD, you know the maturity date of your investment. Perpetual bonds have no fixed maturity, and your money remains with the bank for as long as it needs the funds. Moreover, agents mis-sell perpetual bonds as limited period bonds as they have a call option. \nBanks can decide when to use the call option and pay back your principal on a particular date or continue paying interest. However, buyers of these bonds believe that banks will exercise the call option after 5 or 10 years. If you are a senior citizen investing in perpetual bonds, you must treat this investment as a perpetual instrument. You cannot use this investment as an emergency fund compared to bank FDs that may be withdrawn prematurely with a minor penalty on interest. \nShould you buy perpetual bonds from the secondary market? A senior citizen who seeks the safety of capital and regular interest income must never buy perpetual bonds. You could purchase perpetual bonds from the secondary market. \nHowever, you may end up buying them at a high yield-to-maturity or YTM. As bond prices move inversely with its YTM, an increase in yield to maturity results in a fall in the bond price. In simple terms, bonds with a higher default risk compensate investors through a higher yield. \nImpact of perpetual bonds on debt funds\nYou may find a circular issued by SEBI, the capital market regulator, on March 15, 2021, causing a stir among investors in debt mutual funds. The mutual fund industry has massive assets of around Rs 35,000 crore in perpetual bonds issued by banks with 100 years. \nYou have SEBI directing mutual funds to value perpetual bonds as 100-year instruments. It has also set a limit of 10% for investments by debt funds in these perpetual bonds, including AT-1 bonds and Tier-2 bonds. The circular would come into force from April 01, 2021. \nYou may have noticed the tussle between SEBI and the Finance Ministry where the Ministry stated that there was no benchmark to value perpetual bonds at 100 years. It has requested SEBI to withdraw the circular relating to valuing perpetual bonds at 100 years. \nThe Finance Ministry believes this provision could result in panic redemption by investors in debt funds and higher borrowing costs for banks when the economy was still recovering from the pandemic. It led to the rise in the yield of perpetual bonds issued by banks. \nYou could find the net asset value (NAV) of debt mutual fund schemes holding perpetual bonds falling if bond yields rise. SEBI wants mutual fund houses to value perpetual bonds as if your principal amount will be returned only after 100 years. It could result in infrequently traded perpetual bonds, seeing a sharp fall in their value. \nYou have many mutual fund houses valuing perpetual bonds based on the assumption that issuers would exercise the call option within 5 to 10 years. You will find severe volatility in the NAV of many debt funds if the SEBI rule valuing perpetual bonds as 100-year instruments goes through. \nSEBI has amended the valuation rules for perpetual bonds after a push from the Finance Ministry. It issued a circular where the deemed residual maturity of AT-1 bonds would be ten years until March 31, 2022. \nYou would find the maturity increased to 20 and 30 years over the subsequent six-month period. However, from April 2023, you would find the residual maturity of AT-1 bonds becoming 100 years from the date of bond issuance. \nYou may invest in any fixed-income instrument if you seek capital protection and regular income. It’s prudent for senior citizens to avoid investing in debt funds for higher return as the money’s safety is of paramount importance. Moreover, retirees must avoid investing in risky AT-1 bonds of banks and other issuers. In a nutshell, you may invest in any financial instrument that you understand to achieve investment objectives depending on your risk tolerance. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at cleyon.dsouza@cleartax.in\nAn Editor by day and a sloth by night…I would love to eat and sleep throughout the day if given a chance…I enjoy reading and love my job and my team at ClearTax."

        "headline": "Fresh e-Invoicing guideline for taxpayers with turnover ranging from Rs.50 crore to Rs.100 crore",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "NIC has released fresh guidelines with less than a fortnight left for businesses with turnover above Rs.50 crore to comply with the e-invoicing system. NIC stands for the National Informatics Centre, which officially manages the Invoice Registration Portal (IRP) or e-invoice portal. \nIt validates and generates unique Invoice Reference Numbers (IRN) and Quick Response (QR) code for every Business-to-Business (B2B) invoice reported on the portal. If your business has a total turnover at PAN-level of more than Rs.50 crore in any preceding financial years from FY 2017-18, begin generating e-Invoices as per the GST law from 1st April 2021. It requires some preparation, making suitable choices and system testing for a smooth implementation across the organisation. \nThe guideline dated 16th March 2021, hosted on the e-invoice portal- einvoice1.gst.gov.in, applies to specific taxpayers with annual aggregate turnover ranging between Rs.50 Rs.100 crore. Also, the government has currently enabled applicable GSTINs for accessing the e-invoicing functionalities on the IRP. However, a business might have to cross-check the status of the same by visiting the portal.\nIf you find that your GSTIN is not enabled, then you can voluntarily request enablement as well. All you have to do is navigate to the ‘Registration’ tab on the homepage. Click on ‘e-Invoice enablement’ and enter the relevant GSTIN, captcha code and press the ‘Go’ button. After that, get registered by re-visiting the ‘Registration’ tab, click on ‘Portal login’, enter the relevant GSTIN, captcha code and press the ‘Go’ button. Henceforth, you can log in easily to the IRP. \nThe guideline states that eligible taxpayers can also register for e-invoice APIs to integrate their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or billing system with the e-invoice portal using suitable modes.\nThe guideline also states that these taxpayers can begin preparing and registering live invoices in the e-invoice portal. Download the bulk generation tools for e-invoices to prepare the JSON and obtain the system generated IRNs. Additionally, e-way bills can also be generated for their IRNs. As a word of caution, the guideline mentions that the IRNs and e-way bills generated in the production environment will be valid and real and cannot be discarded.\nA summary of the e-invoice API access modes or mechanism has been provided too. As per the guideline, there are four ways to integrate your ERP system with that of the government’s IRP or e-invoice portal. These companies have direct access to APIs, taxpayers having access to e-way bill APIs, access through GST Suvidha Providers (GSP) and access through ERPs. \nUnder the direct access mode, the taxpayer may have tied up with ERP directly accessing IRP. The business can then use the same API through that ERP company. The business generates its username and password for each of its GSTIN. In turn, it gets API access using the client ID and client secret of that ERP company.\nIf there is existing access through e-way bill API, then the same client ID, client secret, username and password can be used for IRP. Next up, a business can use the client ID and client secret of the licensed GSP through a tie-up. In return, it can generate its username and password for easy API access. The advantage of using GSP is that the business can stay up-to-date with the e-invoice portal releases and downtime updates while also enjoying value additions.\nLast on the list is API access through ERP. It remains precisely the same steps as given for API access through GSP. However, it has been seen from the past that the portal releases’ readiness and receptiveness are slower in this case compared to access through GSPs. It is due to the multiple testing requirements on the ERP service provider’s shoulder before releasing an update on the product.\nUnder e-invoicing, any applicable business must raise B2B invoices, as in the past, on its ERP system. After that, it must report the same on the government’s IRP. The portal will validate the invoice details and sign them using the government’s digital signature. It will generate a unique QR code and IRN and send back a signed e-Invoice. Further, these B2B invoice details will be automatically populated into your GSTR-1 and, wherever applicable, will also generate the e-way bills for you. \nIf you fail to be ready by 1st April 2021, you may be subject to a penalty of up to Rs.25,000 per invoice. It is charged for issuing a non-compliant invoice under GST law and can, in turn, affect your relationship with your GST registered customers, who might not be able to claim the pre-validated input tax credit.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at annapoorna.m@cleartax.in\nAnnapoorna, popularly known as Anna, is an aspiring Chartered Accountant with a flair for GST.

The fund manager picks stocks of companies that focus on environmental-friendly practices, social responsibility and ethical business practices. \nYou will find the fund manager focusing on environmental, social and corporate governance and financial data such as earnings growth to pick the right companies. It helps determine the growth prospects of these companies in the long-term. \nShould you invest in ESG Funds?\nYou could invest in ESG funds if it matches your investment objectives and risk tolerance. It is suitable for an aggressive investor who prefers to invest in companies that follow ethical business practices and have a good image.\nYou can have a part of your large-cap allocation towards ESG funds. You may find several ESG-complaint companies already a part of your large-cap portfolio. However, you can consider the investment if you want an inflation-beating return over the long-run.\nESG funds may offer the twin-benefits of sustainable investing and better return as compared to several equity funds. It invests in businesses that score high on ESG-compliance and follow clean accounting practices. Moreover, having a high ESG score is suitable for a business in the long run. \nYou are investing in stocks of well-run companies that may do well compared to businesses that cut corners to earn higher profit over some time. It helps garner foreign investment as these investors focus on sustainable companies. You will find ESG-complaint companies being able to raise foreign capital quickly compared to other businesses. \nYou have investors in India, similarly focusing on ESG-compliance as global investors. It means money could pour into stocks of companies with high ESG scores as investors refine their portfolios over some time. You will find stock prices of ESG-complaint businesses rising, which pushes up the returns from ESG funds. \nYou must invest in ESG funds with a time horizon of over five years. It helps if you allocate around 5-10% of your portfolio towards this theme. You may invest in ESG funds based on your risk profile as it is a thematic fund with a high-risk rating. Moreover, it is a relatively new investment in India, and you could struggle to find an ESG fund with a good track record of performance. \nCan ESG investments increase your portfolio returns?\nYou may believe that investors put money in stocks and equity funds only to maximise returns. You would find companies seeking to maximise shareholder wealth by focusing solely on profits. It led to business damaging the environment and exploiting the workforce in search of higher returns. \nYou have ESG investors forcing companies to focus on better corporate governance, environmental-friendly policies and clean business practices. However, will this approach reduce portfolio returns if you invest in ESG funds?\nYou will find companies with a higher ESG score performing well over the long-run. For example, businesses with sound corporate governance would face lesser governmental regulatory hurdles, contributing to better earnings. \nMoreover, foreign institutional investors who invest heavily in the Indian stock market prefer good accounting practices and clean management. You will find the stock prices of these ESG-complaint companies rising steadily over some time. \nYou may believe that a focus on environmental-friendly practices may compromise profits for the businesses. However, companies that focus on energy-efficient practices and bring in newer technologies to reduce dependence on fossil fuel have performed well. \nFor example, many cement producers are looking at waste heat recovery systems to reduce costly fossil fuel dependence. It has translated to cost-saving over the long-run. Similarly, plastic processing companies are looking at packaging made of recyclable plastic waste instead of fossil fuel-based packaging. It helps FMCG companies develop their sustainable development goals and keep our oceans free of harmful plastic waste and other chemicals.\nAre Indians investing in ESG Funds?\nIf you wanted to invest in ESG funds in India in 2019, you would find only a couple of ESG mutual fund schemes. However, many AMCs lined up NFOs in ESG funds in 2020 and 2021 following the coronavirus pandemic. \nIndia has around 43 crore millennials which make up about 34% of the population. It is a generation that is conscious of climate change and the benefits of sustainable investments. Moreover, investors and regulators are clamping down harshly on companies that don’t follow environmental-friendly practices. \nWhat returns can you expect from ESG funds? If you consider data as of October 30, 2020, you have the Nifty ESG index delivering a return of 10.8% CAGR over five years as compared to 8.99% CAGR for the Nifty 50. However, you may take these results with a pinch of salt as many ESG funds don’t have a good track record of performance. \nYou have India as the first country in the world to make CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) compulsory under the Companies Act, 2013 for businesses above particular profitability and turnover. It means these businesses must spend 2% of the previous three years’ average net profit towards CSR. It could encourage sustainable investing in India. \nWhat are the pitfalls ESG investments face in India?\nYou have the Indian mutual fund industry focusing on the ESG theme as investor awareness improves. It means businesses with low ESG scores will have to improve fast or risk losing investments from foreign institutional investors or FIIs. You will find the ESG theme promoting a responsible attitude towards the environment and society. It helps companies navigate regulatory hurdles as investors focus on the twin benefits of sustainable investing and higher returns. In a nutshell, you will find companies becoming ESG-complaint as the ESG theme gains traction among investors in India. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at cleyon.dsouza@cleartax.in\nI write to make complicated financial topics, simple.

        "headline": "Who can potentially fill the colossal credit gap for MSMEs: Banks, NBFC or Fintech?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Mr Kamal, a freshly qualified mechanical engineer, is a budding entrepreneur who comes from a humble middle-class family. He aims to set up a decently sized workspace for starting his business but needs financial support. Upon approaching a bank, he is told to present a business idea, show income records, projections, provide collateral, and so on. He is in a fix as he may not give most of what is asked for, holds a zero credit history, and is denied the requisite loan/credit. \nKamal’s story resonates with several aspiring entrepreneurs in the small business sector who may be put in the ‘credit unworthy’ situation. Given a chance, Kamal could have established a fairly operating business in a span of six months to a year. Else, he must approach an unorganised lender, prone to higher interest rates. Banks continue to be hesitant to fund new businesses than already established or large companies, not without a valid reason but due to the economies of scale, India’s financial and banking ecosystem and bad loan history itself. \nThe story narrated above and similar ones that have occurred past several years have led to a whopping USD 240 billion credit gap for the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) in India. In Indian rupees, this worked out to Rs.17.40 lakh crore and was published by IFC-Intellecap in its 2019 study report. Ironically, the Indian MSME segment contributes to more than 45% of its output yet faces a lack of easy access to funding. If this continues, India may witness the downfall of its MSME sector and, in turn, threaten the survival of several industries.\nA credit gap refers to the difference between the total external credit demand created and the cumulative supply of finance from all the formal sources. The normal banking channels finance about 16%-20% of the MSMEs in India, a minimal number. It means that any formal banking system does not finance a wider sect accounting for about 80% at all, says the report. \nThe MSME sector plays a vital role in nation-building due to its significant contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), exports, and job creation. Despite their demonstrated growth record and contribution to the economy, financial institutions have underserved businesses in this sector. \nIn addition to financial resources, they need access to new market opportunities, customer databases, and emerging technology. These can help them increase their competitiveness, efficacy, and resilience in the new normal. MSMEs will also need access to services that could help them develop a resilient infrastructure to continue operating in the changing market climate.\nMost of the business owners in the MSME sector face challenges, including being educated and financially literate. From not maintaining complete books of accounts to not affording collateral assets for loans, problems are aplenty. In a gist, due to the lack of collateral securities, vague credit histories, inadequate accounts and records, many MSMEs are unable to access financial product suites and services.\nSince the segment is so diverse, financial institutions regard it as a high-risk investment. Not to forget, the majority of the companies are family-owned, and the promoters tend to obtain financing from unorganised sources, often at exorbitant rates. A lack of credit history hinders banks’ ability to determine the integrity of such units. \nBanks face difficulties due to poor bookkeeping and financial planning, precisely the ones mentioned as MSMEs’ problems. Fear of a poor credit rating and a reluctance to dilute equity holdings make it much more challenging to obtain structured financing and establish a better track record for potential needs. PSU banks are far better in MSME lending when compared to their private counterparts.\nThe question to be asked is how the MSMEs can come out of the situation. Various policy initiatives such as the industry cluster development, the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), the All-India SME exchange, the skill development program, the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST), and the government’s GST-compliant MSME loans: “Rs.1 crore in 59 minutes” all have created a sustainable environment for MSMEs and opened up formal finance channels from commercial banks, small finance banks and NBFCs. \nMost of the schemes are at a snail’s pace in terms of adoption and reach. Immediate results cannot be expected from these but will benefit in the long span. An alternate and trusted source of financing is the need of the hour. Thus, come the digital lending platforms and fintech to the rescue. \nFintech firms pose creativity, using new-age technology and adopt customised lending techniques backed by predictive analytics and artificial intelligence. It assists in real-time decision-making, enabling them to reach out to the last mile consumer. In recent times, some well-known fintech firms provide services such as translating scanned financial bank statements into customised formats for fast decision-making and providing borrowers with digital channels for easy access to credit. \nTheir operations accelerated during the COVID-induced lockdown around the same time last year. Fintech-backed lenders are more convenient for their clients, and they respond to their needs with a sense of urgency that banks frequently lack. Fintech and digital lending platforms offer short to long term lending and offer working capital loans as well. Lending is done for a period as short as seven days.\nLending by fintech stands apart due to the extensive use of technology, making their product far more efficient in signing off the financial risk and having a good reach. It also helps them replicate or outperform the traditional informal lending sector. Moreover, these fintech firms have co-lending and securitisation to their support.\nA report known as “Fintech for Asian SMEs” released by the ADB Institute in 2019 quotes that while new SME-focused fintech firms may take some market share from traditional banks, they are most likely to serve many borrowers currently rejected by the traditional firms. An increase in the overall size of the market will likely offset the market share lost to newcomers. Going by this claim, we can say that fintech and digital lending may take the lead in bridging the long-standing MSME credit gap in the years to come. \nHowever, to equally reap the short and long-term benefits of financing MSMEs, banks are rapidly adopting the digital environment, automating back-end processes, investments in capacity building with several trade associations and creating customised credit products, especially during the COVID pandemic. \nSo, one cannot completely rule out banks’ contribution, including the NBFCs, since they have a more substantial presence in tier II and tier III cities, including rural areas across India. Digitisation in banks and relaxation of stringent credit lending norms can have multiplier effects in plugging the MSME credit gap. It equally calls for the expansion and promotion of digital lending and SME focussed fintech firms on operating in rural areas. \nOn the other hand, a more passive way to bridge the colossal credit gap is by improving MSMEs’ liquidity position, making them self-sufficient to meet their working capital needs. It can happen through faster sales realisation and increased receptiveness towards invoice discounting over platforms like the government’s TReDS. Extension of the e-invoicing system under GST to MSME in the coming years will pave the way for private invoice discounting platforms and fintech to emerge as promising contributors in fixing the big MSME credit gap.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at annapoorna.m@cleartax.in\nAnnapoorna, popularly known as Anna, is an aspiring Chartered Accountant with a flair for GST.

        "data": "The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has been coming up with more and more solutions to make the EPF structure easy and accessible to the general public. One such measure taken is allowing the employees to update the date of exit online without having to wait until the employer does it. \nThis is a crucial move by the EPFO as there were many complaints and grievances due to the lack of timely updation of the date of exit or date of leaving by the employer.

        "data": "Are you looking to invest in top-performing equity funds this year? Do you seek to maximise your return from equity funds? You may consider investing in the right equity mutual funds rather than chase top-performers. It is a smart strategy to invest in equity funds based on your financial goals, investment horizon and risk appetite. However, should you chase top-performing equity funds?\nWhy do investors chase top-performing equity funds?\nYou may consider putting money in last year’s top-performing equity funds to earn a high return. It is an investment that has outperformed the market in recent years. Moreover, you believe these top-performing equity funds could continue to do well in the future. \nYou have several investors looking to put money in equity funds based on past performance. Moreover, mutual fund houses market equity mutual fund schemes as being solid performers in the past. You may invest in past performers despite the printed warning that past performance doesn’t guarantee that the equity fund would do well in the future. \nYou may find many colleges gauging your performance at high school before giving you a seat. You may check the record of a builder before buying an apartment. In much the same way, you must check the AMC’s track record and the investment style of the fund manager over some time before investing in equity funds. \nHowever, you must also check the equity fund portfolio, expense ratio, and the assets under management (AUM) to check if it matches your investment objectives and risk tolerance. \nShould you chase top-performing equity funds?\nYou may want to exit your current equity fund and switch to a top-performing equity mutual fund. You find that your equity fund has underperformed the benchmark index over the past few months. However, an equity fund cannot be a top-performer all the time. \nYou may consider checking the performance of your equity fund over the past year. You may exit your investment only if the fund manager has changed the investment style and are uncomfortable with the new style. Moreover, you could redeem your equity fund if some of the fundamental attributes have changed. \nStudies have shown that equity mutual fund toppers in one year may be completely different from toppers in the following year. It shows why it’s futile for you to chase top-performing equity funds. Moreover, chasing top-performers could result in additional expenses of 2% per year as many equity funds have a higher expense ratio. \nYou have studies showing that no equity fund can consistently outperform the market all the time. It may go through a bad phase but could recover over time, maximising return over the long-run. Moreover, you may end up buying units at a higher price and selling at a lower price if you keep changing between equity funds, making it tough to attain long-term financial goals. \nYou can stay with equity funds if they match your investment objectives and risk profile. You must follow the buy and hold strategy and stick with the right equity funds over the long-term to achieve your financial goals. Moreover, you can continue investing in equity funds through SIP irrespective of whether the stock market rises or falls. \nYou may exit your current equity fund as you are chasing the next top-performer for a higher return. However, this fund may go through a bad phase, and you would always be switching between equity mutual fund schemes. You lose the compounding benefit where you must stay invested in the right equity fund for the long run to maximise your return. In a nutshell, you must focus on picking the right equity fund rather than chase top-performing equity funds. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at  cleyon.dsouza@cleartax.in\nI write to make complicated financial topics, simple.

        "headline": "e-Invoicing to Apply to Businesses With Turnover Exceeding Rs.50 Crore",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The CBIC has released a notification on 8th March 2021 confirming that e-invoicing will apply to businesses with turnover exceeding Rs.50 crore from 1st April 2021. After months of speculation on what would comprise phase three of India’s latest digital reform, an official release now confirms the latest applicability norms.\ne-Invoicing was introduced in India on 1st October 2020. Phase one saw large businesses, i.e., businesses with turnovers exceeding Rs.500 crore, coming under its scope. From 1st January 2021, phase two began and was extended to companies in the Rs.100 to Rs.500 crore turnover range. The third phase will begin this April and include businesses entities having turnover of more than Rs.50 crore under its purview. \nThe government’s objective is to bring all businesses under the scope of electronic invoicing or e-invoicing, facilitate universal machine readability of invoices, automate the GST return and e-way bill processes, and reduce reporting errors, and to eliminate fraud. The advantages of e-invoicing do not end here. For a business, adopting e-invoicing means lesser data entry and lesser workforce employed, reduced GST return filing and e-way bill generation, and ease of claiming input tax credits.\nIf your business falls under phase three of e-invoicing, i.e., Rs.50 crore and above, then you need to prepare your organisation to adopt this digital reform right away. There are three weeks to go, but three weeks are not enough to begin the process of integration, sandbox testing and staff training, and understanding various other process workflows that come with this new system.\nHere are some benefits of an early transition into e-invoicing:\nAllowing sufficient time for integration means that your organisation can explore various integration options that best suit your business needs. Once integration and vendor have been chosen, the ERP can be configured, and sandbox testing can be carried out to check for any bugs in the system. This process takes anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on your vendor and integration choice. With sufficient time in hand, bugs can be identified and fixed to smooth transition once e-invoicing gets officially implemented.\nOne of the biggest advantages of an automated integration option, such as an API-based integration, is eliminating manual errors. This is beneficial in terms of generating and uploading invoices and also in the filing of GST returns. When fewer errors are committed, better overall compliance can be achieved. If you transition early, you basically make way for your system to run error-free during the testing stage itself, well before the mandatory stage gets rolled out.\nGetting systems integrated now requires a lot of time and effort. This could lead to the task being put off as far as possible. However, if your business falls in the third phase of e-invoicing, you know that you cannot avoid this transition. Once you integrate, the amount of time and the costs saved in the long run are humongous. Automating operations now will lead to reduced manpower and greater efficiency once the processes get stabilised. Hence, it is wise to integrate as early as possible so that you start enjoying the benefits right away.\nAn organisation can enhance its business continuity by generating e-invoices instantly through integration. If you plan to use the services of a trusted GST Suvidha Provider (GSP), you can even mitigate most business continuity risks as the GSP will offer various advanced features that not just facilitate easy e-invoice generation but will also streamline other compliance processes within your organisation. Some of the features that you should look for when you select an integration are a bulk generation of e-invoices, PAN-level data ingestions, automated vendor communications, bulk JSON uploads and downloads, advanced user access management, and data security features. \nIf your business is already eligible to generate e-invoices or will be eligible to adopt this reform soon, it will best that you don’t wait any longer and find yourself a reputed vendor to help you make this transition as soon as possible, to make it as smooth as possible for you.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "headline": "EPFO retains an interest rate of 8.50% to its subscribers for FY 20-21",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The Central Board of Trustees, Employees Provident Fund (EPF) held a meeting in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir under the chairmanship of Shri. Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Union Minister of State for Labour & Employment (Independent Charge), where an 8.50% annual interest rate was recommended to be credited on EPF accumulations on members’ accounts for the financial year 2020-21. The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has around five crore active subscribers.\nThe EPFO has consistently generated returns at 8.50% since FY 2014. It provided an interest rate of 8.5% for FY 2019-20 and 8.65% for FY 2018-19. The Ministry of Labour stated that after the interest rate is notified officially in the government gazette, it will credit the interest rate into the members’ accounts.\nAll along, it has been able to distribute higher income to its members with minimal credit risk through various economic cycles. The interest rate of EPFO is higher than other investment avenues available for subscribers. The EPFO maintains a high-interest rate despite consistently following a conservative approach towards investments and placing a considerable emphasis on the safety and preservation of the principal first approach.\nThe SBI fixed deposits offer interest of 5.4% with a maturity period of 5-10 years. The SBI fixed deposits will earn an annual return of 3.8% post-tax for people in the 30% tax slab. The Public Provident Fund (PPF) gives 7.1% on deposits, but the investment is capped at Rs.1.5 lakh per annum. The EPFO deposits will effectively earn annual returns of over 11% due to the current tax-free status for its subscribers in the 30% tax slab.\nThe EPFO started investing in equity through exchange-traded funds based on the NSE 50 and BSE 30 indices during 2015-16. Initially, the investment in equity assets was 5% for 2015-16 and subsequently went up to 15% of the incremental portfolio. \nThe interest rate of 8.50% recommended by the EPFO for FY 20-21 results from combining income from interest received from debt investment and income realised from equity investment. Thus, the EPFO provides a higher return to its subscribers while maintaining a healthy surplus acting as a cushion to provide a higher return in the future. Even after the income distribution, there will be no overdrawn on the EPFO corpus with a surplus of around 300 crores.\nBoth the employer and employees contribute 24% of the basic salary plus dearness allowance towards EPF every month. An employee can withdraw EPF after his retirement, i.e. after 55 years. However, an employee can withdraw 75% of the EPF corpus after one month of unemployment. The employee can withdraw the remaining 25% if he/she remains unemployed in the next month or transferred to the new EPF account after getting new employment. \nWhen an EPF subscriber withdraws EPF in the final settlement, and there is no notification of the interest for the current year, the interest will be credited to the subscriber based on the interest declared for the immediately preceding year. If the subscriber withdraws the EPF in the current year, then the interest will be credited from the beginning of the year till the last date of the previous month of final settlement withdrawal.\nThe EPFO grants a significant gain to subscribers with a high-interest rate. Since EPFO invests in a person’s retirement savings, the risk appetite is low. The EPFO’s assured fix return approach, along with the tax exemptions, makes it an attractive choice for investors. The EPF is a substantial social security measure in the form of provident fund, insurance scheme and pension.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at mayashree.acharya@cleartax.in\nI am an Advocate by profession.

        "headline": "Repeal of annual GST audit can help businesses save up to Rs.30,000 crore",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "GST audit requirement has been removed from the CGST Act by an amendment through the Finance Act, 2021. Two officials from the Ministry of Finance have recently remarked that the move saves audit fees of approximately Rs.30,000 crore currently spent by about 10 million business firms, as per unconfirmed sources. \nThe comment has come in when the tax professionals have expressed their discontent about the Union Budget 2021 announcement for removing the GST audit. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), the Chartered Accountants’ professional body (CA) in India, has approached the Ministry represented by Nihar N. Jambusaria, the newly elected President. Accordingly, the press quoted him saying, “We are of the view that provisions on GST audit and reconciliation statement certification by a CA must be retained in the GST law. An audit is not avoidable compliance, but is a preventive necessity.”\nOn the other hand, these officials further stated that the GST audit had been removed to reduce the compliance burden. They were quoted by media reports that “The Finance Bill, 2021 will revise the current GST law, and the CBIC will notify this sooner or later. The fundamental intention was to expand the GST base by reducing compliance burden and assist businesses, specifically small firms, save money by not paying audit fees to professionals.”\nThe Union Budget 2021 proposed an amendment to Sections 35 and 44 of the CGST Act. Section 35(5) has been wholly omitted to remove the GST audit’s mandatory requirement and submission of the certified reconciliation statement in Form GSTR-9C. Whereas Section 44 has been replaced to remove compulsory furnishing of the audited reconciliation statement. \nInstead, it allows the filing of Form GSTR-9 (GST annual return) on a self-certification basis. The move is yet to take effect as the CBIC is yet to notify the same. Subsequently, the CBIC has clarified that GSTR-9 and GSTR-9C submission will continue to apply for FY 2019-20, currently due by 31st March 2021.\nIndustry experts maintained that while removing the GST audit eases the compliance burden, it is likely to have a ripple effect in other checks. Henceforth, the businesses must become vigilant about whether data going in the GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B while filing matches with books of accounts. They must also have yearly checks to ensure that the GST returns’ turnover is reconciled with the audited financial statements. \nThe independent tax professionals would have looked into these matters with the GST audit and reported any tax shortfall and the computation of penalties and interest levy. Self-certification may not be effective in detecting these mismatches and fulfilling the tax obligations. It may cause revenue leakage to the government.\nWhile the tax officers can call for special audits as per the GST provisions, that may not be as effective as GST audits. Further, President Jambusaria added, “Revenue recognition for accounting, when compared to GST law, is done differently. Therefore, the reconciliation statement must be approved by a CA who is well-versed in both accounting and GST. GST audit carried out by CAs will uphold the concept of maker-checker. It will thereby detect deviations and errors in GST compliance.” \nHe further pointed out that as of 12th February 2020, around 12 lakh taxpayers had to submit GSTR-9C. The audit should not be assumed as a cost to the business. Instead, it must be considered as an investment with the benefits reaped over time.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at annapoorna.m@cleartax.in\nAnnapoorna, popularly known as Anna, is an aspiring Chartered Accountant with a flair for GST.

        "headline": "Here’s How Following the Rule of 15*15*15 Helps You Get Rich",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Mutual funds are among the most sought after investment avenues lately. It is because all mutual fund plans are managed by a finance professional called the fund manager who has an excellent track record of managing wealth. You don’t need to know how the markets work or have enough time to manage your investment. The fund manager would take care of everything, and you only have to invest. \nProfessional fund management and no requirement to manage the investments on your own have made mutual funds suitable for any individual to invest. The rule of 15*15*15 has made mutual funds even more attractive for investors. Following this rule is the simplest and easiest way to raise your first crore of rupees. \nThe rule of 15*15*15 says that on investing Rs 15,000 through a month SIP into a mutual fund plan which offers annualised returns at 15% for 15 years, your investment account would read Rs 1 crore. Here, time is key and you should not skip your SIP instalment. If you do, you will delay accumulating Rs 1 crore.\nHow does it work?\nWell, mutual funds are powered by compounded returns, which is nothing but the return on returns. The power of compounding is capable of growing your small investments into a large sum when your investment horizon is longer. The following table shows what compounded returns are capable of:\nNote: The above calculations are made considering the annual rate of return is 15%.\nHowever, the challenge lies in identifying mutual fund plans that have the potential to provide 15% annualised returns. Even though all the fund plans are managed by a fund manager who is backed by a team of market researchers and analysts, not every fund provides you 15% annualised returns. \nThis is because only a few mutual fund plans have the mandate to allow the fund manager to invest in securities that may provide annualised returns of 15%. Liquid and overnight funds do not have this potential as the underlying securities mature within a short period of time. In that case, which are the mutual funds that can provide 15% annualised returns? Here’s the answer:\n1) Index funds\nThese are a class of equity funds that track and emulate the performance of a popular stock market index such as BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty 50. The Indian benchmark indices have performed exceptionally ever since their inception. In fact, the value of BSE Sensex has tripled over the last 11 years. Therefore, investing in an index fund is a great option. Furthermore, the underlying stocks of an index fund are large-cap or bluechip. Which means, your investment grows as the market leaders grow. \n2) Mid and large-cap funds\nMid and large-cap funds are a type of equity funds whose asset allocation is made mostly towards the mid and large-cap stocks. These funds are expected to do well over a period of five years and longer. The growth potential of mid-cap stocks powers the gains in these funds while the stability of large-cap funds provides the much-needed balance to the portfolio. \n3) Sector funds\nSector funds are a class of equity funds whose asset allocation is made towards one particular sector such as banking, technology and energy. You have to identify those sectors that have a high growth potential in future and seek to invest in them. For instance, the investors who invested in IT sector funds in the early 2010s would now be enjoying high gains as the NSE Nifty IT index has nearly tripled its value since 2010. It entered the year 2010 at around 5,250. Likewise, there are many other sectors that have performed well, and you need to identify them. \nConclusion\nFollowing the rule of 15*15*15 is the easiest and simplest way to amass Rs 1 crore in your investment account. Apart from realising Rs 1 crore in the form of long-term capital gains, you will also be getting dividends whenever declared by the companies. It is advisable that you choose the ‘growth option’. Choosing this option would enable the reinvestment of your dividends back into the fund, which helps you accumulate Rs 1 crore faster. \nHere, you have to be relentless in your investment and patience is the key. Apart from investing in index funds, Mid and large-cap funds, sector funds, you may also consider mutual funds with international exposure, value funds and small-cap funds. However, the risk levels of these funds are on the higher side, which shouldn’t be a problem when your investment horizon is longer.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at vineeth.nc@cleartax.in\nEngineer by qualification, financial writer by choice.

        "headline": "Maturity Proceeds of ULIPS are Taxable: Should You Consider It Now?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Investing in mutual funds and unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs) are two of the most popular investments among individuals in India. Both investment avenues are capable of providing good returns. Previously, there were some differences in how the maturity proceeds of a ULIP and capital gains of an equity fund were taxed. \nThe Union Budget 2021-22 has proposed some amendments to bring a level playing field between equity mutual funds and ULIPs. Now, there is some parity in the way that these avenues are taxed. The maturity proceeds ULIPs which were previously tax-free, are now taxable in the hands of investors. \nBefore we decide which investment avenue is beneficial, let’s first understand what exactly these investment avenues offer for individuals/investors. \nWhat exactly is a ULIP?\nA ULIP is an investment product which combines insurance and investment. Since there is an insurance component in ULIP, the amount you pay towards purchasing a ULIP is essentially termed as ‘premium’. The premium is split into two components. The first component of the premium goes towards securing your life, and the second component is invested. \nWhat is a mutual fund?\nA mutual fund is a professionally pooled and managed investments from various individuals and entities with common investment objectives. It is utilised to purchase assets as per the investment mandate with the sole view of providing investors with optimum returns. Depending on the equity exposure, mutual funds are classified into debt funds, equity funds and hybrid funds. \nULIPs vs mutual funds: Where should you invest?\nYou need to note that the returns offered by a ULIP will be restricted as compared to mutual funds. This is simply because the entire amount you pay towards a ULIP is not invested as some of it goes towards availing a life cover. Since only some portion of the premium is not invested, the return you get on ULIP as an ‘investment’ is low. \nIf you are to earn higher returns, you have to invest in a mutual fund. All mutual fund plans are handled by a professional fund manager who is backed by a team of market analysts and experts to make investment decisions that benefit investors in the long run. Let’s analyse both ULIPs and mutual funds from various angles:\nLock-in period: Open-ended mutual funds come with no lock-in period while ULIPs require your money to be locked-in for a period of five years. If you are to save taxes with mutual funds, you could invest in an equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS). If you are looking for liquidity, then investing in mutual funds is the right option. \nTaxing maturity proceeds: Until Budget 2021, the maturity proceeds of ULIPs were tax-free if the annual premium was less than 10% of the sum assured. The maturity proceeds are taxable if the annual premium of a ULIP is over Rs 2.5 lakh. The applicable tax rate is 10%. On the other hand, the long-term capital gains of an equity mutual fund are taxed at 10% only if they are above Rs 1 lakh a year. Given this, the tax advantage that ULIP once had is no longer available.\nApplicable charges: Investing in ULIPs is costlier as compared to mutual funds. A ULIP comes with fund management charges, mortality charges, premium allocation charges, and policy administration charges. All these charges put together amount to a significant sum. On the other hand, mutual funds charge a nominal annual maintenance fee in the expense ratio. If you are to optimise the cost of investment, mutual funds are a better option.\nConclusion\nThe amendments made in the Union Budget 2021-22 have made ULIPs lose the tax advantage. The maturity proceeds are now taxable if the annual premium exceeds Rs 2.5 lakh. Instead of investing in a ULIP, one may consider investing in an ELSS and purchase term life insurance separately. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at vineeth.nc@cleartax.in\nEngineer by qualification, financial writer by choice.

        "data": "Do you want to diversify your equity portfolio with mid-cap and small-cap stocks? Are you looking for a mutual fund to create wealth in the long term? You may consider putting money in flexi-cap funds. It invests a minimum of 65% of the total assets in equity and equity-related instruments. You may find flexi-cap funds investing across large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks. It offers mutual fund managers the freedom to put money in stocks across market capitalisation, to generate returns for investors over some time. However, should you invest in flexi-cap funds?\nWhat are Flexi-cap Funds?\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), passed a circular on November 09, 2020, announcing a new category of equity funds called flexi-cap funds. It is an equity-diversified mutual fund that invests in stocks across market capitalisation. \nThe fund manager selects stocks across different sectors and market capitalisation depending on the mutual fund’s investment objectives. The asset management companies would choose a suitable benchmark index to gauge the performance of flexi-cap funds. \nWhy did SEBI create a new category called flexi-cap funds?\nMulti-cap funds invest a minimum of 65% of the total assets in equity and equity-related securities. The multi-cap mutual fund scheme’s fund manager may pick stocks of companies in different sectors and industries across market-capitalisation. However, you would find the fund manager investing most of the multi-cap fund assets in large-cap stocks.\nYou would find many investors putting money in multi-cap funds. It emerged as the largest category of equity funds with assets under management (AUM) of Rs 1.13 lakh crore as of March 31, 2020. \nSEBI wanted multi-cap funds to stay true-to-label and put money in stocks of various sectors and industries across market capitalisation. It passed a rule on September 11, 2020, where multi-cap funds had to invest a minimum of 75% of total assets in equity and equity-related instruments. Multi-cap funds also had to maintain a minimum allocation of 25% each, towards large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks. \nMutual funds had to comply with these rules by January 31, 2020. However, several AMCs and fund managers opposed the new rule as multi-cap funds invested heavily in large-cap stocks. It would be difficult to liquidate large-cap positions and invest significant amounts in mid-cap and small-cap stocks to adhere to the market capitalisation requirements, without significantly impacting prices. Mutual fund managers wanted SEBI to reconsider the rules on multi-cap funds. \nSEBI created a new category of equity funds called flexi-cap funds, rather than review the rules for multi-cap funds. It allows fund managers to invest in stocks of companies in different sectors across market capitalisation. Moreover, flexi-cap funds had to put a minimum of 65% of total assets in equity and equity-related securities. \nAlso Read: What You Should Know About Home Insurance in India?\nYou would find many AMCs recategorising multi-cap funds as flexi-cap, to retain their existing portfolios. It allows fund managers to invest in large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks based on opportunities in the market, to generate a higher return. However, you may find flexi-cap funds continuing to invest a major portion of the assets in large-cap stocks. \nShould you invest in flexi-cap funds?\nYou may consider investing in flexi-cap funds only if it matches your investment objectives and risk tolerance. Flexi-cap funds could invest in mid-cap and small-cap stocks. You may put money in these funds if you are an aggressive investor with an investment horizon of over five years. \nYou may find flexi-cap funds investing heavily in large-cap stocks for some time. The fund manager may shift assets to mid-cap and small-cap stocks depending on investment opportunities. However, you could find fund managers sticking to large-cap stocks in the current scenario, owing to a dearth of small businesses’ quality investments. You could invest in large-cap funds instead of flexi-cap funds if you prefer putting money in large companies’ stocks. \nYou may find several mutual fund houses recategorising multi-cap schemes as flexi-cap to adhere to SEBI’s new rules. You may stay with your investment as AMCs have only changed the scheme’s name and the category. You would find the flexi-cap scheme maintaining the same investment objectives, portfolio allocation and the team to manage the fund. \nIf you have invested in multi-cap funds, you have a mandatory 30-day window to redeem the mutual fund units without any exit load. You won’t incur short-term or long-term capital gains tax depending on the holding period if your multi-cap fund has been recategorised as a flexi-cap fund. However, if you redeem units, the sale proceeds are subject to capital gains tax. \nYou could check the fund house’s track record and the fund manager’s investment style over three to five years. You may continue with your investment if you are happy with the fund house’s performance and the mutual fund manager. However, you may exit the flexi-cap fund if it has underperformed compared to peers over some time. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at cleyon.dsouza@cleartax.in\nI write to make complicated financial topics, simple.

        "headline": "GST collections for January 2021: What does it mean for the coming months?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "For January 2021, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections touched a new high of almost Rs.1.2 lakh crore. The levels suggest a sharp post-lockdown recovery and improved compliance, reflected through the record number of returns filed of about 90 lakh.\nAs per the press release by the Ministry of Finance (MoF), dated 31st January 2021, the total monthly GST collections till 6 p.m. of 31st January 2021 is Rs.1,19,847 crore. The total amount collected towards CGST is Rs.21,923 crore while SGST stands at Rs.29,014 crore. The IGST is Rs.60,288 crore whereas the cess is valued at Rs.8,622 crore.\nAs a regular settlement, the government has paid out Rs.24,531 crore towards CGST and Rs.19,371 crore towards SGST, out of the IGST collected. After that, the final revenue to the Central Government’s coffers and the state governments, respectively stand at Rs.46,454 crore for CGST and Rs.48,385 crore for SGST.\nThe recovery trend in GST revenues has been on the forward path since the last five months. The revenue collection for January 2021 has increased by 8% MoM basis. The GST revenue collected for December 2020 was about Rs.1,15,174 crore, being the highest since GST implementation until then.\nRevenues from imports of goods were 16% higher during the month, and revenues from domestic transactions (inclusive of imports of services) have increased by 6% compared to January 2020. In the second half of the FY 2020-21, the average YoY growth in GST revenue has turned positive at 8% compared to (-) 24% during the first half.\nClear signs of a rapid post-pandemic economic recovery are seen with the steep rise in the monthly GST revenue over this time. The press release stated that several factors contributed to the rise. These include closer surveillance against fake-billing, deep-data analytics using data from various sources, including GST, income tax and customs IT systems, and efficient tax administration.\nSince November 2020, 2,700 cases have been lodged against 8,500 fake entities, and over 274 people have been arrested. The data-driven initiative has helped the department to collect Rs.858 crore from these entities.\nThe coming months will have revenue collections at higher levels, with the GSTR-9 deadline for FY 2019-20 on 28th February 2021 and the financial year coming to a close. In the long run, the outcome of Union Budget 2021 looks promising to fuel the consumption levels from the FY 2021-22 onwards.\nGST implementation is also set to get a significant facelift with the interlinking of the GST return filing, the importance of reconciliation, simplification of compliance for MSMEs, etc. Filing is expected to become a lot easier without technical hassles since several deadlines are already distributed across the month. Further, the introduction of the Quarterly Return filing and Monthly Payment of taxes (QRMP) scheme will ensure easier compliance for the MSMEs.\nThe focus of the department will now shift towards assessments and audits. Mostly, the regular taxpayers will be under the scanner. Businesses must therefore make sure to avoid differences between GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B every time.

        "headline": "Customs Duty Slashed on Gold: How Should You Invest in Gold?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The Union Budget 2021-22 was presented on Monday, the 1st of February 2021 by Nirmala Sitharaman, the Union Finance Minister. This year’s budget was expected to address the various financial woes resulting from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there were no major changes in the way individuals are taxed. \nThe stock markets have reacted positively to the budget amendments as there are no uncertainties and no significant policy changes made. In fact, the BSE Sensex regained its 50,000 levels this week. A considerable modification from the individual’s point of view is that the senior citizens aged 75 years and above are not required to file ITR if their income sources are pension and interest. The paying bank will deduct taxes. \nGold prices are on the bull run since the COVID-19 pandemic took over the world as investors preferred to preserve their capital amidst market volatility. Gold prices touched their fresh peaks and made the yellow metal unaffordable for most individuals. Previously, the customs duty on gold was 12.5%.\nThe Finance Minister proposed to reduce the customs duty to 7.5% in her budget speech on Monday. Furthermore, the Finance Minister also proposed to levy farm cess, which translates into reducing the customs duty on gold to 2.5% points. This means you can purchase gold at a lower price. \nNow, the question is – should you purchase gold jewellery for the sake of investing in gold? The answer is simply no! It is never advisable for anyone to ‘invest’ in gold jewellery. You may purchase gold jewellery for consumption but not as an investment. As you might already know, gold jewellery comes with additional costs.\nWhen you buy a piece of gold jewellery, you will be levied with making and wastage charges by the maker. These charges have made gold jewellery unattractive as an investment. These are a one-time cost borne at the time of purchase, and you will not be able to get this amount while you are selling your jewellery. \nTherefore, you may not consider gold jewellery as a viable option to invest in gold due to reduced customs duty. Instead, you may consider other ways of investing in gold. The following are the better ways of investing in gold as compared to purchasing gold jewellery:\ni) Gold ETF\nA gold exchange-traded fund or gold ETF is an open-ended mutual fund whose price is tied to gold’s prevailing price in the market. Gold ETFs are also referred to as paper gold. One unit of a gold ETF is equivalent to one gram of purest gold. The reduction in customs duty has resulted in the reduction of the cost of units of gold ETFs. To add to that, gold ETFs don’t come with any making or wastage charges, making them a better option than gold jewellery.  \nThe budget amendments also proposed setting up of spot gold exchange, for which the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) would be the regulator. A gold exchange was needed for a long time as some of the key market players are being underserved by the existing market infrastructure. Having a gold exchange helps make the whole process transparent, and offers the twin benefits in the form of more efficient price discovery and adding to the liquidity pool. \nii) Sovereign gold bonds\nSovereign gold bonds (SGBs) are issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The price you can purchase and redeem these bonds is tied to the prevailing gold price in the market. You will also get an annual interest at the rate of 2.5%, making SGBs an excellent investment option. \nThe capital gains earned on selling physical gold is taxable in your hands. On the other hand, if you hold SGBs until their maturity, you won’t incur any tax on capital gains. However, you can prematurely sell your SGBs in the secondary markets. In such cases, capital gains become taxable. \nA major advantage of investing in SGBs is that you don’t get to hold gold physically, which alleviates the risk of theft and cost incurred towards securing gold. Therefore, investing in SGBs is a far better option than purchasing physical gold. The issuance of the next tranche of SGBs (Series XI) will be made on the 9th of February. If you have not subscribed yet, then you have a chance to do so until the 5th of February.  \niii) Gold mutual funds\nGold mutual funds are a class of equity funds that invest in directly or indirectly in gold reserves. These funds invest in companies involved in gold production, mining and distribution. Most gold funds are open-ended. Since the underlying instrument in these funds is gold, the cost of fund units of gold funds is directly tied to the market’s gold price. \niv) Gold bars and coins\nIf you like to hold physical gold, you may consider purchasing gold bars or coins instead of gold jewellery. Although the making and wastage charges are not non-existent, their extent of levying on gold bars and coins is negligible compared to jewellery and ornaments. \nHowever, you may have to incur a cost to preserve them securely as banks charge a considerable annual maintenance fee for their safety lockers. In case you want to avoid holding physical gold and save yourself from incurring making and wastage charges, you have to invest in gold ETFs, gold mutual funds or SGBs. \nHow much should you invest in gold?\nGold is traditionally considered as a hedge against market volatility and inflation as its prices don’t fluctuate significantly over a short period of time. Most financial advisors and planners recommend constituting up to 15% of your portfolio with gold. However, if you are keen on capitalising on the wealth creation opportunities that gold may throw up over time, you may consider increasing your exposure to gold. \nConclusion\nThe Union Budget 2021-22 gave a pleasant surprise to investors. The customs duty on gold has been reduced from 12.5% to 7.5%, and with the levying of the newly introduced farm cess, the net reduction in the customs duty on gold is 2.5 percentage points. However, you may not consider investing in physical gold as an ‘investment’. Instead, you may invest in gold ETFs, mutual funds, and SGBs as they are more cost-effective than gold jewellery. In case you like to hold gold physically, you may consider gold bars and coins as they come with much lower making and wastage charges. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at vineeth.nc@cleartax.in\nEngineer by qualification, financial writer by choice.

        "headline": "Did Budget 2021 Impact GST the Way Taxpayers Expected it to?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "India’s first digital budget was announced on 1st February 2021 by Finance Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman. The FM made announcements spanning agriculture to healthcare to customs rate revisions. However, nothing major was announced on the GST front in terms of easing compliances, much to taxpayers’ disappointment.\nLet’s take a look at the Budget 2021 changes in GST:\nITC restricted to details furnished by the suppliers \nThe Finance Bill has proposed a new clause (aa) in Section 16 sub-section 2 of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act. According to this clause, input tax credit (ITC) on an invoice or debit note can only be availed when the supplier has furnished such details in his statement of outward supplies, and the details of which have been communicated to the recipient. \nRule 36(4) of the CGST Rules has already been in place for a while now. As per Rule 36(4), provisional ITC is already restricted to 5% of the eligible ITC basis, the details uploaded by the suppliers. It is assumed that this provisional ITC can still be claimed, in addition to the actual ITC uploaded by the suppliers in accordance with this newly inserted clause.\nSec.35 and Sec.44 amended to omit mandatory audit requirements\nThe FM did not specifically announce that GST audit will no longer be a mandatory requirement. Previously, the same had to be compulsorily carried out by taxpayers whose turnover exceeds Rs.2 crore, and a duly certified reconciliation statement needed to be obtained by a Chartered or Cost Accountant. \nWith an amendment proposed in the Finance Bill, in Section 35 sub-section 5 of the CGST Act, there will no longer be a mandatory requirement to get the annual accounts audited under GST and a reconciliation statement submitted by a specified professional. The same has now been omitted. \nSection 44 of the CGST Act has also been substituted to remove the mandatory requirement of furnishing the reconciliation statement that has been audited by specified professionals, by providing for the filing of annual returns on a self-certification basis. The Commissioner has also been given the power to exempt a class of taxpayers from filing the annual GST return.\nFiling of GSTR-9 and 9C has been a complicated affair for small taxpayers. It has also cost them a lot of money as a Chartered or Cost Accountant needs to be engaged to verify the accounts and certify the reconciliation statement. With this requirement’s omission, it will now be simpler for small businesses to submit their annual returns with a self-certification. \nApplicability of GST on a supply made for a consideration (Cases of AOPs, societies, etc.)\nThe government has clarified the applicability of GST on transactions involving the supply of goods or services by any person other than an individual, made to its members or vice versa, for a consideration. In sub-section 1 of Section 7 of the CGST Act, a new clause (aa) has been inserted in this regard. This will apply with retrospective effect from 1st July 2017. \nInterest is to be charged on the net tax liability\nWith retrospective effect, Section 50 of the CGST Act has been amended to charge interest only on the net tax liability due. This means that interest will only apply to the liability that is to be paid via cash.\nNo appeal can be filed unless 25% of the penalty has been paid\nSection 107 sub-section 6 of the CGST Act saw a new proviso added, to mandate that no appeal shall be filed against an order made under Section 129 sub-section 3 of the CGST Act unless the appellant has paid a sum equal to 25% of the penalty. Section 129 lays down the procedure in regard to the detention, seizure and release of goods. \nThese law updates are more administrative in nature, except for the removal of the GST audit requirement, which will definitely benefit taxpayers. It would have been good to see fewer compliances in day-to-day GST accounting. The government has simplified GST to a large extent by introducing the Quarterly Returns Monthly Payments (QRMP) scheme, e-invoicing system, etc. However, claiming ITC has too many restrictions, leaving taxpayers irked and constantly worrying about receiving demand notices. Maybe in the future, the law would be simplified in this regard.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "data": "The Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget on February 01, 2021. Auto manufacturers have reason to cheer after announcing a voluntary vehicle scrappage policy to phase out old vehicles. You may find commercial vehicles of 15 years or more and personal vehicles of 20 years or more phased out under the vehicle scrappage policy. It would boost demand for newer vehicles which do not pollute the environment. Let’s take a look at what Union Budget 2021 offers the auto sector in India. \nUnion Budget 2021 announces voluntary vehicle scrappage policy\nThe Finance Minister has announced a voluntary vehicle scrappage policy to phase out unfit vehicles. It was a long-awaited scrappage policy which could boost the auto sector as old polluting vehicles are eliminated. You would find the demand for newer environment-friendly personal and commercial vehicles rising as auto manufacturers ramp up production. \nThe voluntary vehicle scrappage scheme applies to personal vehicles of 20 years or more and commercial vehicles of 15 years and above. You would find vehicles having to undergo a fitness test at an automated fitness centre. \nIt may encourage vehicle owners to replace old, unfit and polluting vehicles with newer environment-friendly vehicles as the scheme may offer monetary incentives. It could be road tax rebates on the purchase of a new vehicle. However, further details are awaited which could bring clarity on the voluntary vehicle scrappage policy. \nHow the Union Budget 2021 could boost the auto sector in India?\nThe auto sector has witnessed a slowdown in sales since 2019. The voluntary vehicle scrappage policy could be a gamechanger which may boost the sale of automobiles in India. \nYou may find many old commercial and personal vehicles polluting the environment. The voluntary vehicle scrappage policy could boost the demand for fuel-efficient vehicles that are environment-friendly. It could reduce India’s crude oil import bills and kickstart demand in the automobile sector. \nThe Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced a capital investment to the tune of Rs 5.54 trillion to develop infrastructure around the country. It could boost demand for commercial vehicles as owners replace older vehicles with newer models. You would find the material from older vehicles recycled which could reduce the cost of manufacturing buses, cars and trucks. It could make India a vehicle manufacturing hub and also reduce the prices of commercial and personal vehicles in India. \nThe Finance Minister has incentivised the setting up of startups in India with a proposal to extend the tax holiday by one more year up to March 31, 2022. You would find many electric two-wheelers in India manufactured by electric vehicle startups. This move could boost the production of electric two-wheelers as petrol and diesel prices are on the rise. \nYou may find rising fuel prices, weak consumer sentiment after the pandemic and higher prices of vehicles due to government safety regulations, leading to a decline in the sale of automobiles. The voluntary vehicle scrappage policy could boost demand in the auto sector and may promote the rise of electric vehicles in India.

        "data": "The Union Budget 2021 has given a big boost to the stock markets in India. The BSE Sensex has gone up by 2,314 points and the Nifty 50 by 646 points. India’s healthcare sector got a major shot in the arm as the government plans to spend Rs 64,180 crore on the Aatmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana, a new centrally sponsored scheme, over the next six years.\nThe scheme would develop the primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare sectors and focus on creating institutions to detect and cure new and emerging diseases. You would find the common man looking to buy an affordable home. The Finance Minister Mrs Nirmala Sitharaman has extended the tax holiday on affordable housing projects for one more year, providing a boost to the country’s affordable housing segment. Let’s look at what the Union Budget 2021 offers to investors. \nThe government retains its focus on the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and the ‘Housing for all by 2022’ mission. You would find affordable housing dominating India’s real estate market with 50% of new real estate launches. \nYou may avail a tax deduction under Section 80EEA of the Income Tax Act, on home loan interest for affordable housing. You can save an additional Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year on home loan interest, over and above the Rs 2 lakh, you already save under Section 24(b). \nYou qualify for the tax deduction under Section 80EEA if you purchase a house where the house property’s stamp duty value is up to Rs 45 lakh. You get a tax deduction up to Rs 1.5 lakh per year on the interest you pay for the home loan sanctioned up to March 31, 2021. After Union Budget 2021, you may avail the Section 80EEA tax deduction on affordable housing projects up to March 31, 2022. You will be happy hearing this announcement if you are a first-time buyer of affordable residential property. \nThe Finance Minister Mrs Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed a permanent institutional framework to purchase investment-grade bonds which are stressed. It could enhance the liquidity of corporate bonds in the secondary market and boost India’s debt mutual fund sector. The mutual fund managers believe it is a positive move for credit risk funds and banking and PSU debt funds. \nDebt funds which put money in corporate bonds would benefit from this move. The new framework brings liquidity to the debt market. It boosts investors’ confidence, who have been affected by corporate bond investments in debt fund categories over the past years. \nYou could expect a good return from credit risk funds, corporate bond funds and Banking and PSU funds after creating a permanent institutional framework to buy stressed investment-grade securities. \nInsurance is a capital-intensive business and badly needs funds to promote insurance penetration in India. The Finance Minister has proposed to enhance the FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) limit to 74% from the current 49% with relevant safeguards.\nYou would find the insurance sector in need of funds after the coronavirus pandemic. Many Indian partners of insurance companies could not infuse further capital into the business. The Finance Minister has solved this problem as foreign capital would flow into the Indian insurance sector. \nIt would increase insurance penetration and build digital and infrastructure capabilities in the insurance sector after the coronavirus pandemic. \nThe Finance Minister has stated that India’s Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) would go for an IPO (Initial Public Offer) in FY 2021-22. It could be the largest share sale on the stock market. \nThe government currently owns 100% of the stake in LIC. You would find the government conducting the LIC IPO in tranches. It may divest up to 25% stake in the Life Insurance Corporation of India. \nThe Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will notify SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India), the capital market regulator, as a regulator for gold exchanges. The Union Budget 2021 was a great one for investors in the stock market, with the absence of moves such as imposing wealth tax or increasing LTCG tax on equity. The Budget focused on economic growth at the cost of widening the fiscal deficit.\nThe equity investors were mighty pleased as there was no change in securities transaction tax (STT), capital gains tax or addition of a COVID tax.

This year’s budget allotment towards the MSME sector is nearly twice as last year’s. The Finance Minister said that the government has come up with several steps to support the MSMSE sector. \nTo ensure that the cases are resolved faster, the Finance Minister said that the NCLT framework would be strengthened. The e-Courts system will be implemented to facilitate this, and other ways of debt resolution and a distinctive framework for MSMEs will be brought in place. \nIndustries, particularly MSMEs, have been hit hard by a steep rise in iron and steel prices. The budget proposed to reduce the customs duty uniformly to 7.5% on flat, semis, and long products of alloy, non-alloy, and stainless steel. Besides, the duty on steel scrap has been made exempt until the 31st of March 2022 to provide relief for metal recycles, who mostly happen to be MSMEs. \nApart from that, the Anti-Dumping duty (ADD) and Countervailing Duty (CVD) on some steel products are being revoked. The duty on copper scrap is now reduced to 2.5% from 5% to provide relief to copper recyclers. The textiles sector is creating numerous employment opportunities and contributing enormously to the economy. \nThis calls for rationalisation of duties on raw materials tailored for humanmade textiles. The government has decided to bring the nylon chain on the level with polyester and other similar fibres to facilitate this. The BCD rates on caprolactam, yarn, nylon and nylon chips are now uniformly reduced to 5%.

This budget was expected to address the financial hardships that have arisen due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Various changes proposed are expected to benefit taxpayers, investors and depositors. \nHowever, this year’s budget amendments have not provided any major relief concerning personal income tax. There are no changes in the income tax slab rates as the Finance Minister decided not to touch the two existing income tax slabs. In case you are not aware of the current income tax slabs, here they are:\nThere are no modifications made to the standard deduction and the extent of tax deduction available under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

In such cases, the paying bank will deduct the applicable tax. \nThe Finance Minister proposes extending the additional tax relief of Rs 1.5 lakh for home loan borrowers under the affordable housing scheme to encourage housing for all. Initially, this additional tax relief was announced in July 2019 and was extended in the previous year’s budget until March 2021. This relief is now extended for home loans availed under affordable housing until the 31st of March 2022. \nEarlier, the income tax assessment could be reopened for up to six years. The Finance Minister has now amended this time limit to three years. Furthermore, in cases where serious tax evasion is noticed, the tax assessment in such cases can be reopened for up to ten years, with the consent of the Principal Chief Commissioner. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at vineeth.nc@cleartax.in\nEngineer by qualification, financial writer by choice.

        "headline": "Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana – Is there a need for an extension?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) was launched by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas on 1st May 2016. The government introduced this scheme to be implemented for three years, i.e. the financial year of 2016-2017, 2017-18 and 2018 – 2019. This scheme provides LPG connections to Below Poverty Line (BPL) households. The LPG connections under this scheme are given in the name of the women beneficiaries of the household. Under this scheme, EMI facility is also provided for stove and refill cost.\nThe government introduced this scheme because most rural households were using fossil fuels to prepare food in India. The rural and BPL households had not availed LPG connections. The usage of fossil fuels affects the health of women of such families. Thus, the government decided to introduce this scheme and provide financial support amounting to Rs.1,600 for each LPG connection given to the rural and BPL families. This scheme provides an incentive for rural households and BPL families to obtain LPG connections. \nPMUY aims to provide free LPG connections to all BPL households, thus providing clean fuel for cooking. It frees women from health hazards of using firewood and collecting wood. It also aims to make every household smoke free. The scheme aims to cover five crore women. \nThis scheme provides interest-free loans for purchasing a gas stove and refilling the cylinder, and the government bears the administrative cost of every LPG connection. The LPG facilitates clean cooking fuel to BPL and rural households. The LPG prevents health hazards related to indoor air pollution and brings about qualitative changes in living standards. By providing LPG connections to BPL and rural households, the government will ensure universal cooking gas coverage in India.\nAt the time of launch of PMUY, the government targeted to cover five crore BPL households to provide deposit free LPG connections by 31st March 2019. The government achieved the initial target of 5 crore BPL households after just 28 months of its launch. In August 2018, around 47% of the beneficiaries were from the weaker sections of the society (SC/STs), as per the government’s data. The states of Uttar Pradesh (87 lakh), Bihar (61 lakh), West Bengal (67 lakh), Odisha (30 lakh), Madhya Pradesh (45 lakh) and Rajasthan (37 lakh) accounted for 65% of the total connections. \nSince the government achieved five crore target, there was an increase of target to eight crore households. A budgetary allocation of Rs.12,800 crore was provided in 2018, to achieve the increased eight crore target. The government reached the target of eight crore by 7th September 2019. \nAlso Read: Pre-Budget Memorandum: Industry Body Asks to Bring Natural Gas under GST Ambit\nWomen belonging to BPL households, who do not have an LPG connection will qualify to be beneficiaries under this scheme. However, they should be included in the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 list or under the seven identified categories. These seven identified categories are – Tea and Ex-Tea Garden Tribes, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Gramin) beneficiaries, Antyodaya Anna Yojana beneficiaries, SC/ST households, people residing in river islands, Forest dwellers and Most Backward Classes (MBC). \nInitially, PMUY was launched by the government to be valid till 2019. The government set out the target for this scheme to be eight crore, and they reached this within 2019. There was no continuation of this scheme beyond 2019. But to combat COVID-19 crisis, in March 2020, the government announced that the PMUY beneficiaries would receive refills of up to three cylinders of 14.2 kg from April to June 2020 under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana scheme. The PMUY beneficiaries will also receive an advance of the retail selling price. \nThe Oil Marketing Companies (OMC) will transfer the retail selling price to the PMUY customer’s bank account. The PMUY customers can withdraw the retail selling price to obtain refill from the distributor. This benefit was valid till 30th September 2020. The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd provided more than 11 lakh free LPG in Maharashtra to the PMUY beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana scheme in April.\nAccording to the data given by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, the OMC’s transferred a free refill advance of Rs.296 crore to the PMUY beneficiaries in Maharashtra. There were 13 lakh bookings for refill and delivery of 11 lakh cylinders in Maharashtra in April. \nThe state-run oil retailers issued a circular in June stating that the beneficiaries who have received payment for a refill for April and May will have to pay for the third cylinder’s refill. The OMC, however, noted that they would reimburse the amount of refill of the third cylinder after there is a reflection of confirmation of the LPG distribution on its portal.  \nIn June, as per reports, there was a distribution of only 42% of the cylinders. But, there should have been a distribution of around 240 cylinders in three months. The government had provided three cylinders as part of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana to PMUY beneficiaries to be valid till 30th June 2020. On 6th July 2020, the government announced that the beneficiaries of PMUY who are poor women could avail the unclaimed three LPG cylinders till 30th September 2020. \nThe government gave the extension till September to help the beneficiaries cope with the economic difficulties caused by the country’s lockdown. Plus, all the beneficiaries could not avail three cylinders’ quota since many rural or BPL households do not consume one full cylinder in one month. The government gave the extension to the beneficiaries who were provided credit for a refill but could not purchase a refill due to various reasons. Under this scheme, there was more than ten crore LPG supply to the poor households between April and June.\nThe government launched the PMUY to provide LPG cylinder connections to the rural household and make India kerosene free. The rustic and BPL homes use fossil fuels for cooking which is dangerous. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recognised this scheme as the Government of India’s decisive intervention. The WHO praised India’s Government for addressing indoor air pollution through this scheme, which accounts for nearly 10 lakh deaths in the country in a year. \nThe government introduced this scheme to be implemented over three years, i.e. 2016 to 2019 and allocated Rs.8,000 crore totally to implement it. The government also used the money saved from the ‘Give it up’ subsidy campaign for this scheme. There was no extension of this scheme beyond 2019. With the achievement of 5 crore households target in 2018, there was an increase in target to 8 crore households. The government achieved the eight crore households target in 2019. \nThe scheme ended in 2019 though there was no formal declaration. The official website of this scheme became inoperative. Only three states, i.e. Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab and five UT were declared kerosene free. However, the government announced that three LPG cylinders refills would be provided to this scheme’s beneficiaries from April 2020 to June 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak. There was an extension of this benefit provided to the beneficiaries till September 2020. \nThough there was no extension of this scheme, the government provided the benefits under this scheme from April 2020 till September 2020. There was an expectation of extension of this scheme. But, there was no extension of PMUY or the benefits of refill provided to the beneficiaries beyond September 2020. \nPMUY benefits rural and BPL households and women in the country. It helps in reducing indoor air pollution. It prevents grave illness and infant death due to pollution and smoke at home. There are around millions of households in India under the BPL category. As compared to the millions of BPL households, the target of 8 crore is very minimal. \nA WHO report states that around 4.3 million deaths were because of household air pollution. Use of fossil fuels for cooking causes indoor air pollution and affects health. The fossil fuels used for cooking at homes affect the women who cook and the whole household members. Due to all these circumstances, it is necessary to extend this scheme and provide free LPG to more BPL households who do not have LPG connections at home.  \nThe Parliamentary Committee on Petroleum was upset with the end of this scheme. Before the pandemic outbreak, a report was put forth in the Parliament in March 2020 to extend this scheme to the urban and semi-urban slum areas for covering more households under this scheme. But, there is no news of the extension of this scheme by the government to date. The government has launched various other schemes but has not considered the extension of this scheme. The PMUY is one such social welfare scheme that requires an extension to benefit rural and urban poor and BPL households.\nThe government needs to consider extending this scheme to the urban and semi-urban poor households. Not all BPL families were covered under this scheme during the three years of this scheme. The government needs to cover the left out BPL households during the scheme’s implementation previously by extending this scheme. This scheme improves the quality of homes of people. It will result in providing clean air and ease in cooking for the poor and urban slum households. Thus, there is a requirement for the government to give a second thought on the extension of this scheme.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at mayashree.acharya@cleartax.in\nI am an Advocate by profession.

        "headline": "Expected Theme for Budget 2021",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Our Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is all set to announce the Budget 2021 on February 1. With less than a week left for the Budget announcement, there are all sorts of fuming expectations across the entire nation. \nPeople have high expectations from the Budget, which will be announced after the world economy was shut down for almost half of the year in 2020 and started to pick up. \nWhat do you mean by the theme of Budget?\nThe Budget usually gives an idea about the government’s intention and focus of the particular sector and industry. \nIt throws light on the areas which are prioritised by the government for providing stimulus. The themes reflect the sectors and industries which are going to get a hand from the government. \nWhat was the theme of Budget 2020?\nThe central theme of Budget 2020 was ‘Ease of Living ‘supported with three pillars. \n(i) First was ‘Aspirational India’ where the focus was to improve the standard of living by giving easy access to health, education and employment opportunities. \n(ii) Second was ‘Economic development’ for all by better productivity and efficiency. \n(iii) Third was ‘Building a caring society’ which is both humane and compassionate. The focus of this was women empowerment, social welfare, preserving culture by promoting tourism.  \nThe focus of Budget 2020 was boosting income, elevating the purchasing power and thereby improving the standard of living of the citizens. \nAlso Read: Budget 2021: A boost to e-commerce Industry is vital\nWhat is the expected budget theme for 2021?\nBudget 2021 that is to be announced on February 1 will go paperless for the first time. \nThis Budget is expected to address and focus around below mentioned themes.\nThe biggest concern in the past year has been the decline of GDP. GDP of 2020-21 is estimated to have been contracted by -7.7 per cent. The government’s main focus would be reviving the pandemic hit economy’s growth by extending their hand to the sectors that have faced significant down growth. This could be done by providing some tax reliefs, subsidies, government expenditure on infrastructure etc. in these sectors like travel and tourism including aviation, hospitality, automobile, education, real estate, financial services etc. \nHence, ‘Growth and recovery’ could be one of the major themes of the Budget 2021. \nThe Budget could significantly focus on the ‘Indian Agriculture Industry’ which has been of great support and stood still in these trying times. Despite GDP contraction, Indian agriculture reported a growth of 3.4 per cent in Q1 of FY 20-21. \nThe government shall consider spending more on improving the warehousing and cold storage facilities. India has only 6300 cold storage facilities out of which 60% are concentrated in UP, Gujarat, West Bengal and Punjab. \nWith the introduction of ‘Farm laws 2020’ there has been a lot of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst the farmers. The government would focus on providing reliefs to the farmers. Further, it remains to be seen what steps are proposed by the government to reach a consensus with the farmers either modifying or by accepting the demand from farmers to withdraw the three Farm laws, 2020. \nThe pandemic showed us that no country could take health care lightly. Strong and robust health care should be the nation’s topmost priority. During the peak of covid cases, our country’s health care system struggled to provide beds and ventilators to the increasing number of patients which made the news headlines. Therefore the government would be keen on improving the health care system by increasing its expenditure. The government could also focus on research in medicine and pharmaceutical by increasing the spending in these segments. \nThe Modi government may prioritize the creation of employment opportunities by giving a boost to the sectors which generate higher jobs. As per the statistics, the unemployment rate was highest on April 20 and May 20 in the wake of national-wide lockdowns due to pandemic. The situation improved from June 20; however, the unemployment rate remains an area of concern. \nBudget 2021 would likely focus on investments/incentives in high employment generating sectors like infrastructure, construction, textiles, affordable housing, SMEs -MSME. These key areas may get priority focus from the government. \nThe real estate sector’s growth plays an essential role in a country’s GDP, employment generation, and attracting domestic and global investments. The government may look into liberalizing the FDI (foreign direct investment) rules presently governing the real estate and increase grant of credit linked subsidies allowed on purchase of a residence in the Union Budget 2021. \nThe Union Budget 2021 is expected to give utmost importance to the major hit industries. It would be around the themes of “Growth and recovery of the economy, along with a boost to agriculture, healthcare, housing and manufacturing under Aatmanirbhar Bharat’. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at jyoti.arora@cleartax.in\nI am a Chartered Accountant by profession with  4+ years of experience in the finance domain.

        "headline": "Implementing a suitable e-Invoicing System for E-commerce Operators",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The e-invoicing system applies to businesses with a total turnover exceeding Rs. 100 crore in any previous years from FY 2017-18, starting from 1st January 2021. The 1st phase that began from 1st October 2020 covering companies with turnover of more than Rs.500 crore is already a success. More than six crore e-invoices were created in December 2020 alone. One has to note that apart from sellers, this system subsumes the e-commerce operators such as Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal, to name a few. \nIf an E-Commerce Operator (ECO) is raising any Business-to-business (B2B) invoices on behalf of the supplier, then the e-invoicing system applies to it as well. The applicability depends upon the annual aggregate turnover of the supplier and not the e-commerce operator. \nThe Invoice Registration Portal (IRP) has facilitated the e-commerce operator to report such B2B invoices and credit or debit notes issued on behalf of the supplier. Once the signed Invoice Reference Number (IRN) and QR code are generated, it can be shared with the e-tailers and their customers. \nIt means an ECO can report his own invoice and invoice raised on behalf of his sellers. Invoices generated by ECO for itself can be with respect to either sale of its own goods or services online or the invoices raised on the e-tailers for commission charges. It should be noted that online sellers who are raising invoices themselves will not make the ECO liable for e-invoicing. \nThe eligible e-commerce companies are identified based on the type of taxpayer, ‘TCS’ chosen at GST registration. As per an advisory released by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), eligible e-commerce operators must report their GSTIN in the “EcmGstin” attribute in the e-invoice schema, apart from the seller’s GSTIN.\nSeveral important Application Programming Interfaces (API) are available for e-commerce operators to interact with the government portal while uploading the e-invoice payload as follows:\nIt must be noted that the ECO cannot access the IRNs that are generated by the supplier. Likewise, the IRNs cancelled by the supplier also cannot be accessed by the e-commerce operator. However, the e-way bills generated via IRP by suppliers are still accessible by the e-commerce operator.\nAlso Read: Auto-population of e-Invoice Details into GSTR-1 for December 2020\nIn the early phase of e-Invoicing, the government was contemplating this initiative. Back then, sellers had to authorise the e-commerce operators to generate IRNs specifically. But with this facility introduced since 1st October 2020, it is a significant relaxation given to the ECO to ensure that business does not get halted. However, specific issues need to be looked into by the government.\nFirstly, the e-commerce operator must have a mechanism of identifying online sellers who are subject to the e-invoicing. Although the NIC has made a public list of ‘GSTINs generating IRN’, the online retail is an ever-expanding network. With the e-invoicing system to be extended to smaller businesses in the coming months, the challenge of identifying the notified businesses will rise.\nSecondly, the quantum of B2B sales returns for e-commerce operators may not be as high as for B2C but is still reasonable. Frequent issue of credit notes which also requires an IRN generation will only increase the compliance. Moreover, any correction in the generated e-invoice requires it to be cancelled within 24 hours and the creation of a new invoice with IRN. These are added action items for e-commerce operators.\nThirdly, ECO must segregate the transactions into various buckets such as invoice raised by seller, invoice raised on behalf of the seller, and invoices raised for supplies made by its own. Of the three, the second and third ones require IRN generation.\nIncorrect reporting of an invoice may lead to an additional burden. A prominent example is the reporting of transactions as B2B, while it was B2C in nature. Time-to-time reconciliation of B2B invoices reported to the IRP and auto-populated into GSTR-1.\nFourthly, the real-time generation and handling of e-invoices for own B2B supplies and on sellers’ behalf may become a challenge if necessary systems are not in place. Hence, the government must make special provisions for e-commerce operators as the e-Invoicing system’s scope expands in the coming months.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at annapoorna.m@cleartax.in\nAnnapoorna, popularly known as Anna, is an aspiring Chartered Accountant with a flair for GST.

The RBI stated in a press release that any charges, fees, etc., payable to the LSPs in the credit intermediation process should be paid directly by the REs and not the borrower. \nV Swaminathan, executive chairman of Andromeda loans, stated that online repayments and digital loans had gained prominence post-pandemic. The need of the hour is capable processes and systems that would strengthen the security and data privacy of confidential information shared between regulated entities and customers.\nHe also stated that the cost of compliance might be significant for businesses that still need to revamp their core business models. People need to trust the Central Bank as it deals with government issues and customer complaints about digital lending platforms.\nWhen the RBI issued the guidelines in August, it stated that the instructions were only applicable to existing customers availing fresh loans and new customers getting onboarded. The RBI has stated in its detailed guidelines for digital lending that the primary concerns were a breach of data privacy, unbridled engagement of third parties, misselling, charging exorbitant interest rates, unfair business practices and unethical recovery practices.\nOn 13 January 2021, the RBI established a working group on digital lending, including mobile applications and online lending platforms. The RBI’s regulatory framework concentrates on the digital lending ecosystem of the REs and LSPs, providing various permissible credit facilitation services. The new rules prohibit an automatic credit limit increase without the borrower’s explicit consent.\nREs should ensure that they and the LSPs they employ have an appropriate nodal grievance redressal officer to handle digital lending/FinTech-related complaints. Such grievance redressal officers should also deal with complaints against their respective Digital Lending Apps (DLAs). The websites of the RE, its LSPs and DLAs should prominently indicate the details of the grievance redressal officer.\nThe DLAs are web and mobile-based applications with user interfaces that allow borrowers to borrow from digital lenders. The DLAs would include apps operated by the REs and LSPs hired by the REs to provide credit facilitation services.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at mayashree.acharya@clear.in\nI am an Advocate by profession.

For example, different ministries administer the schemes like the Credit Linked Capital Subsidy Scheme (CLCSS) and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.\nThe portal intends to bring the various government schemes into a single platform so that the beneficiaries can access them without much hassle. The portal is in the pilot testing stage, and the loose ends are being tied up before its launch. The State Bank of India (SBI) and other lenders are testing the portal. Sources stated that the portal would have an open architecture enabling institutions and state governments to onboard their schemes in future.\nThe government launched the loans in 59 minutes portal in 2018 for various kinds of credit products, including home, personal, auto and MSME loans. The portal provides in-principle approval of loans for the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and other borrowers in 59 minutes by different state-owned banks compared to the earlier 20-25 days turnover time.\nAfter receipt of the in-principle approval letter, the disbursement of the loan takes place in seven to eight working days. The portal processes loan applications till the sanction stage without human intervention.\nAn MSME borrower need not submit any physical document for the in-principle loan approval. Instead, the portal analyses data points based on advanced algorithms from several sources such as GST data, income tax returns, bank statements etc. \nWithin two months of launching the loans in 59 minutes portal, state-owned banks gave in-principle approval to 1.12 lakh MSME loan applications, totalling Rs.37,412 crore.

It has also been noticed that ed-tech platforms use technology as a business strategy enhancing tool.\nEd-tech platforms have used AI and ML to improve productivity and accuracy in career counselling, exam invigilation, etc. AI and ML can be a good option for students.\nFurthermore, AI and ML are now being used to conduct several tests online as it gives the option to invigilate the test remotely. An AI algorithm can analyse the authenticity and accuracy of the examination based on photographs taken during an interval. \nEven though tech-based education may upskill students, many experts believe that technology-enabled education has several challenges and risk factors. According to the ministry report on school education 2020-21, post the COVID-19 pandemic, the students’ dropout rate increased from 2.6% to 8.9%. This happened mainly due to irregular online classes and the closure of schools. In rural India, accessibility remains a point of contention resulting in a digital divide.\nWhenever a new technology is implemented, there will be a magnification of inequality. Places with no internet devices and poor connectivity issues will suffer. The government and Non-government organisations (NGOs) need to intervene to look at ways to fix these issues.\nOn the other hand, as per a recent study done, AI and ML are being considered the two most important strategic technologies in addition to cybersecurity. As per the report, up to 72% of the participants have mentioned that AI and ML are part of their IT strategy, business strategy, or both.

        "data": "Recently, the Indian government instructed VPN service providers to record specific information regarding their users for a minimum of 5 years. The Central Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) issued various new directives, and this was one of those.\nThe new directives are expected to take effect from 27 June this year. Nevertheless, industry experts believe that these rules may lead to severe privacy concerns, specifically the ones regarding VPN service providers.\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN) establishes an encrypted connection between the user and the internet, completely safe and secure. With the help of a VPN, users can hide their IP address, browsing history, geographical location, web activities and linked devices.\nAs per CERT-In’s new rules, VPN service providers will need to collect and store specific information for a minimum period of five years, even when a customer has ended the subscription. The personal data that needs to be collected and stored includes names, emails, IP addresses, contact numbers and the reason for using the VPN service.\nCloud service providers and data centres will need to comply with these new directives. If they do not follow these norms, they will be penalised with a jail term of up to one year. All organisations must maintain logs of their Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems in India as per the new regulations.\nThe Internet Freedom Foundation has expressed that the ambiguity around what information is covered under their ICT systems can lead to severe concerns such as private enterprises or the government having access to more data than required.\nIndustry experts have also raised concerns about how this new data collection and retention requirements will assist in enhancing cybersecurity. Furthermore, localisation requirements will also lead to concerns regarding surveillance, mainly when there is no dedicated data protection authority.\nThree VPN service providers have reportedly confirmed that they will not follow the new data collection rules and will continue to use their no-logs policy. This is because they opine that a 180-day log retention rule concerning the ICT systems is ambiguous; the new rules could undermine cybersecurity. The new rules could put personal data at risk of a leak, and the data retention rule is counterintuitive as there is no data protection authority for ensuring data is being used only for cybersecurity purposes.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

Nevertheless, this option is tedious and hence remains unpopular.\nThere are 400 million+ feature phone users in India. With UPI 123pay, these users will get more options to access UPI. Feature phone users can perform transactions based on four technology alternatives. These alternatives include app-based functionality in feature phones, calling an IVR number, proximity sound-based payments, and missed call-based approach.\nFor making a UPI payment via a pre-defined IVR number, a user will need to make a secured call using their feature phone to a predetermined number. The user will need to complete the UPI on-boarding formalities to initiate financial transactions without using the internet. With the help of the IVR multiple language options, a user can use this service in their preferred language.\nIn a missed call-based approach, a feature phone user will be able to access their bank account and perform transactions such as transferring and receiving funds, bill payments, regular purchases, etc., by giving a missed call on the displayed number at a merchant outlet.\nA merchant will create a token at the billing time using a customer’s mobile number and the bill amount pertaining to his purchase. A customer will get an incoming call for authenticating the transaction by entering the UPI PIN.\nProximity sound-based payment will use sound waves to facilitate offline, contactless, and proximity data communication on any device. A user can tap any phone and make a UPI payment to a merchant via a payment solution. A user will need to call the IVR number and choose the Pay to Merchant option. Later, the user must tap their mobile phone on the merchant device and press ‘#’ after the device emits a unique tone.\nA user then has to enter the amount to pay to complete the transaction, followed by the UPI PIN.

It is a welcome initiative that aims to bring down litigation and gives a chance to an assessee before a case gets reopened. With this move, every assessee will get an opportunity to explain their case to an assessing officer. The number of reopened cases would depend on the names cleared by the Insight portal and the time the tax officials have for dispatching notices before the end of the financial year.\nAs per the amended law, the department can go back 11 years (i.e. ten years from the end of the assessment year during which the notice is received) when total income that has skipped tax is presumed to be more than Rs 50 lakh; it is four years when income below Rs 50 lakh escaped taxation. The data uploaded on the portal is procured from overseas authorities, banks, agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate and other third parties.\nAfter a reopening notice is issued within the following fortnight, a full-scale reassessment would begin comprising a recording of all responses and a show-cause notice in less than nine months from the end of this financial year (i.e. by December 2023) will be served.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

The unique face recognition technology will further help pensioners.\nEase of Living for Pensioners \nThe department of pension and pensioners’ welfare has brought about several reforms during the COVID-19 pandemic to release provisional pension or family pension. The department extensively uses technology to provide ease of living to the pensioners, simplify pension-related procedures, and enable them to receive pensions during the pandemic without any hurdles. \nThe department has also introduced the common intelligent software, Bhavishya, for all government of India ministries to process pension cases. It plans to bring out e-booklets for pensioner awareness and conduct awareness campaigns on various social media platforms.\nThe government issues the Pension Payment Order (PPOs) electronically and stores the PPOs in Digi locker, which is a significant step towards transparency. The government has sought ease of living for all sections of the society, including the pensioners and retirees who are the nation’s assets with their vast experience and long years of services rendered by them.\nThe face recognition technology of giving life certificates is a historic and far-reaching reform since it would help 68 lakh Central Government, EPFO (Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation) and state governments pensioners. It eases the procedure of submitting the life certificate and helps the pensioners obtain pensions every month.  \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at mayashree.acharya@cleartax.in\nI am an Advocate by profession.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are all set to be the future of transportation. EVs are not only good for the environment but are more energy-efficient compared to traditional fuel-powered vehicles. \nMany foreign countries have created a vision of ‘zero emissions globally’. Experts estimate that most countries will resort to a hundred per cent reliance on electric vehicles in the next two decades. Countries like Germany and Netherland have the highest number of EVs and substantial charging stations to drive this change. Apart from this global drive to protect the environment, the ever-increasing price of petrol and diesel has shifted customers’ preferences towards electric vehicles. Besides being economical, EVs also come with tax benefits offered by the Income Tax Department of India.\nWith a motive to build a mindset of a sustainable environment and promote the purchase of electric vehicles, the Government of India has introduced a new section to give relief to the buyers of electric vehicles. \nUnder Section 80EEB, a tax deduction up to Rs.1.5 lakh is allowed for the interest paid on loan availed to purchase an electric vehicle. This deduction is an attractive proposition for individuals to choose electric vehicles as their next vehicle purchase. The deduction is available for both four-wheeler and two-wheeler electric vehicles. \nSection 80EEB deduction is eligible subject to the following conditions:\nApart from this, the government has reduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate on EVs from 12% to 5%. Also, some states have exempted EVs from road tax and registration. Other state governments are also considering and might waive road tax on EVs. This will lead to a massive reduction in the purchase cost of the vehicle. Additionally, the government has exempted EVs from the ‘green tax’ introduced recently in Budget 2021.  \nThese benefits overthrow the challenges of electric vehicles like shorter travel ranges and lack of charging points. The infrastructure challenge for EVs is temporary and will get addressed gradually. However, there is a positive long-term impact of EVs on our environment and resources, which is why the government wants to encourage more use of electric vehicles.\nThere has been a gradual increase in the number of electric vehicles visible on roads. Also, many automobiles have now started to manufacture electric vehicles. The electric vehicle industry will soon see many launches coupled with heightened demand from customers. \nWith all these benefits and a healthy environment for our future generations, do you think you would prefer purchasing? \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at jyoti.arora@cleartax.in\nI am a Chartered Accountant by profession with  4+ years of experience in the finance domain.

        "headline": "Online Gaming May Have a Single GST Rate",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "In May 2021, the GST Council had constituted a group of ministers (GoM) to address issues relating to the taxation of online gaming. The government is considering levying a single tax rate instead of 18% and 28% GST currently in force, depending on whether the games are based on skill or chance. With two different rates, there are chances of misuse and litigation.\nA person familiar with the matter said it is sometimes difficult to ascertain whether a game is a skill or chance. For example, even though rummy is a game of skill, the distribution of cards to the players is nothing but chance. Another problem with online gaming is that the age of the persons playing cannot be verified, unlike in casinos. Hence, online gaming should be treated like a lottery or a sin product and should attract the highest rate of GST, i.e. 28%. \nThe GST Council had levied a uniform rate of 28% on lotteries in December 2019. 28% applies to both state-run and state-authorised lotteries. Previously, state-run lotteries attracted 12% GST, and state-authorised lotteries attracted 28% GST. \nThe GoM is expected to report next month to the GST Council after examining all issues related to online gaming and proposing their view on the same. The GoM will also consider whether GST should apply only on the amount retained by the platform or levy on the prize money. The GoM was set up on 24th May 2021, and the panel constituted seven ministers as members under the chairmanship of Gujarat. On 11th June 2021, the finance minister of Telangana joined the group as the eighth member.\nThe final decision will be taken by the GST Council who is the apex decision-making body on matters of indirect tax.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The deployment of ATMs has finally surpassed 250,000 units, after hanging between 225,000 and 235,500 for the last five years. The move to increase the interchange from Rs 15 to Rs 17 concerning financial transactions (and from Rs 5 to Rs 6 concerning non-financial transactions) was seen as a relief. The move with respect to increasing the interchange on cash-pullouts was less than Rs 18 back in 2012.\nThough the RBI circular has been issued in the public interest, the penalty is not probably going to resolve the cash availability concerns. The primary reason for the problem is inadequate cash forecasting, failing to implement the April 2018 RBI circular that covers aspects such as the periodic release of intent, the cassette swap-system, and ATM-fit currency.\nSoon, it may take longer to locate an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) near you. This is because, from 1 October, banks will be levied with a fine worth Rs 10,000 each time a till-box goes empty for more than ten hours.\nThe ATM business is already suffering since it bears high costs to comply with the security regulatory guidelines. Rs 10,000 as a penalty per day is close to nearly 30% of the monthly revenues. If deployers plan to shut ATMs, there will be a direct impact on the Jan Dhan Yojana account holders as they need ATMs to withdraw their direct benefit transfers.\nIn March 2021, the value and volume of ATM transactions stood at Rs 285,268 crore and 6,040 lakh, respectively — not too different compared to the numbers of February 2020, that is, Rs 283,280 crore and 6,189 lakh.\nRural ATMs are facing more significant difficulties. As per the stats, developed countries face cashouts for 11 hours in urban areas and metros; cashouts in rural areas have been seen for 36 to 44 hours.\nThe other issues include logistics related to picking up of cash from Currency Chests (CCs), delays in loading ATMs with money due to poor infrastructure and power cuts, limitations on the cash load timings after its dark, cash losses because of robbery, and stress due to creaky infrastructure due to cassette swaps.\nJoin our Telegram channel to keep getting updates on all things finance.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

        "headline": "10 Amazing Technologies That Are Changing the World",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Do you remember a time when you had to get a new roll of the film put into your camera before a family trip? Or do you refer to encyclopedias for knowledge because Google did not exist? Do you remember the days you could only communicate via telegram or stand in line for that much-awaited and costly international call? Do you remember when you used to send letters and cards to loved ones still??\nWell, all of this was just until 20 or 30 years ago, and yet it feels like a lifetime since modern technology has taken over the world. We are now living in a time where there is a new invention in technology almost every day across the globe. \nThe turn of the millennium witnessed the massive shift from landline phones, VCRs, and floppy disks to mobile phones, USB devices, laptops, and tablets. But it did not stop here. The next 20 years saw a series of fascinating new inventions from high-resolution camera phones to social media buzz, OTT streaming platforms, and driverless cars. We’ve seen it all. \nLet’s now look at these 10 amazing technologies that will change our lives in the future.\nArtificial intelligence is intelligence displayed by machines as compared to the natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals. AI has penetrated almost every sphere, from tax administration to transport to suggestions that pop up on our mobile phones. It has only begun to impact our daily lives, but the heights AI can reach are unimaginable from here. \nIf you have wondered how an advertisement has popped up on your phone for a product you were talking about with a friend, you have AI to thank for it. AI is present in navigation apps, speech recognition apps, recommendation systems (like Netflix and Youtube), security and surveillance, manufacturing and production, and almost everything digital. It affects how we talk, live, work, and act. \nBlockchain technology may have become popular due to cryptocurrencies. It is a list of records called blocks that are linked together with cryptography. It is used for recording transactions and tracking digital assets.\nBlockchain is already used by businesses in their supply chains to pinpoint inefficiencies, data sharing, digital voting, financial services, energy trading, copyright protection, medical recordkeeping, etc. One of the primary advantages of using blockchain is that it increases data security, transparency, and traceability across a network.\nA cloud platform provides on-demand access to data along with computing power via the internet. It enables you to access data that a remote data centre hosts without the need to install the infrastructure at your premises. The biggest advantage of cloud platforms is that it saves on costs tremendously and enables businesses to scale more easily.\nIf you have been wondering where your photos get stored when you “upload to cloud”, well, you have a cloud platform to thank. If you use an online service provider to book your flight tickets and file your taxes, and you can access the same personal information year after year, it is again due to a cloud platform.\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) refers to physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and a processing ability that connect with and exchange data between devices and systems. You may have heard about a ‘smart home’ these days, or perhaps your home has already been transformed into one. This has been made possible with IoT technology.\nIoT has given rise to the Internet of Behaviours (IoB). The IoB links a person to their actions digitally. It uses behavioural science and data analytics to form an in-depth understanding of a person and their behaviour. IoB helps gain deep insights into customer behaviour and is a valuable tool in sales and marketing.\nA driverless car, also known as a self-driving car, is a vehicle that can sense its surroundings and move with little to no human input. Driverless cars rely on radar, sonar, lidar, GPS, inertial measurement units, and other technologies to perceive the environment around them. While driverless cars may not be a reality for India anytime soon from both an economic and safety standpoint, it has been estimated that 10% of vehicles on the road globally will be self-driving cars over the next decade.\nOver the next few years, technology will drastically change how people work. One major technology in this regard is robotics. Robots will do most routine work and even hazardous work. \nThere is also a new term for robots who work alongside people in an organisation called collaborative robots or cobots. It is a robot that is designed for direct human interaction within a shared space. If you have bought a device that can sweep and mop your home at the click of a button, then you are already onboard the robotics revolution. Some other examples of where robotics have been used are in agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, and the military.\nMost of us already use wearable technology such as smartwatches and fitness trackers. But wearable gadgets are still very much an emerging technology. Right now, we have access to health data such as our heart rate, pulse, calories burned, the release of certain biochemicals, etc. \nSoon, we may have access to measuring blood alcohol content, athletic performance, monitoring of heart conditions, health risk assessment, etc. The wearable gadgets will give out warnings to preempt medical disorders so that the user can take timely actions. \nVirtual reality is a simulated experience that can be similar to or different from the real world. Augmented reality is an enhanced version of the real world through digital visual elements, sounds, and other sensory stimuli. The main difference between virtual reality and augmented reality is that virtual reality is completely virtual, as its name suggests, whereas augmented reality uses a real-world setting. \nVirtual reality gets applied in video games, medical training, military training, and other fields that require simulators for training. Examples of augmented reality include games like Pokemon Go, Instagram filters and Snapchat lenses, make-up try-on experiences, etc.\n3D printing is constructing a three-dimensional model from a digital 3D model, with the material being added layer by layer. 3D printing was traditionally done using polymers but has now evolved to metals, ceramics, and other materials. 3D printing is used in food technology to build moulds and cutters, by chemistry and biology students to study molecules and organs, by architecture students to print existing or new designs, etc. It is also used in aerospace, fashion, engineering, consumer products, etc. \n3D printing may find everyday use in households soon. Has a knob of your drawer broken? Well, get a new one 3D printed. Cool, isn’t it? In the future, 3D printing will be used to construct products, structures, and perhaps even buildings in a matter of a few hours or days. \nSpace tourism has been breaking news lately as millionaires and billionaires can now take that much-awaited joyride into space. In simple words, it is human space travel for recreational purposes. The different kinds of space tourism include orbital and suborbital space tourism and lunar space tourism. \nEnvironment experts have been raising concerns that space tourism is accelerating global warming. But, considering how expensive a flight into space is, it is not likely to become a mass means of recreational travel anytime soon.\nJoin our Telegram channel to keep getting updates on all things finance.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "data": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) declines the deadline extension for card tokenisation after the agreed date, i.e. 1 January 2022. RBI confirms that no more one-click purchases will be allowed on merchant sites starting from 1 January 2022. All card details which have been saved will be removed. Card issuers, i.e. banks, will need to render tokenisation services concerning their cards. It will be the responsibility of the card networks to ensure that the rules are followed by all the entities involved without fail.\nTokenisation will be used in online transactions; here, random digits will be keyed in the place of actual card details. With tokenisation, there will be no scope for leakage of customer’s sensitive card details. RBI has also announced that the tokenisation mandate will apply to devices such as mobile phones, laptops, desktops, tablets, wearables like wristwatches, bands, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, etc., that connects to the internet, payment aggregators, and merchants on-boarded by them.\nTokenisation will be done depending on a customer’s consent. Consent will be validated via additional factor authentication. RBI mentioned that card issuers could take token service providers (TSPs) and render card tokenisation services. Card issuers can provide services only for the cards that are issued by or affiliated with them. The same TSPs can tokenise or de-tokenise card data.\nStarting 1 January 2022, you will not be able to save any of your card details. For every online transaction you intend to do, you will need to key in the 16 digits of your card and other information afresh. On keying in your details, information will reach the merchant in random numbers completely unrelated to the numbers you have keyed in.\nHowever, there will be a slight exception for reconciliation purposes or transaction tracking. You will be able to store the last four digits of your card number and card issuer’s name – ‘in compliance with the standards that are applicable.’\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

        "headline": "GST portal updates: Blocking of GSTR-1 and solutions to HSN summary issues",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The GST Network (GSTN) has issued two new advisories on 26th August 2021. Both pertain to GSTR-1 filing by regular taxpayers registered under the GST law, to be followed for all future return filings.\nIssues while reporting of HSN-wise summary in GSTR-1\nEver since the last deadline passed for GSTR-1, the taxpayers have faced some issues while declaring a few HSN codes for the ‘HSN-wise summary reporting of outward supplies’ in Table 12. The GSTN stated that errors were thrown by the system when the HSN codes were left blank in the fields. \nThe taxpayers have various options to fill data in GSTR-1. They can either fill manually on the GST portal or import the JSON file from their computer system onto the GST portal. Alternatively, they can file through third-party software providers or integrate systems directly or using the GST Suvidha Providers (GSP).\nDespite declaring the HSN codes for specific items, the portal declined the same while preparing GSTR-1 data using any of the above modes. In turn, it considered this as missing information at times, throwing the errors listed below while submitting GSTR-1. The GSTN notified suitable resolutions for taxpayers, also given below, following every issue. \nFrom 1st April 2021, businesses must mandatorily report HSN codes of specified digits while raising GST invoices and filing GSTR-1. CBIC issued the Central Tax notification number 78/2020 on 15th October 2020, outlining the mandate. Large taxpayers must report six digits of the HSN code if their annual turnover is more than Rs.5 crore. Small taxpayers must declare four digits of the HSN code if their annual turnover is up to Rs.5 crore. The HSN code reporting of four digits for the Business-to-Consumers (B2C) sales is optional for small taxpayers.\nBlocking of GSTR-1 and IFF if past GSTR-3B is not filed\nThe CGST Rule 59(6) is being implemented on the GST portal from 1st September 2021. A few checks will be in place before filing GSTR-1 or Invoicing Furnishing Facility (IFF) for August 2021.  \nBusinesses must check if they have filed GSTR-3B for the past two months, i.e. up to July 2021, as a monthly filer to file GSTR-1. On the other hand, suppose any Quarterly Return filing and Monthly Payment of taxes (QRMP) taxpayers have failed to file GSTR-3B for the previous quarter ending 30th June 2021. They can neither submit Business-to-Business (B2B) sales on the IFF for August 2021 nor file GSTR-1 once the quarter ends.\nIf taxpayers click on the ‘Submit’ button after preparing GSTR-1 or while using the IFF, the GST portal might throw an error message if GSTR-3B filing of past tax periods is pending. In turn, it saves such GSTR-1 or IFF data until the taxpayers comply with the CGST Rule 59(6). Since it is system-automated, the tax officers will be unable to intervene for unblocking the GSTR-1 filing. Hence, the only solution would be to file the past GSTR-3B returns before proceeding to the GSTR-1 and IFF filing for August 2021. \nAny delay by the GST-registered suppliers in producing invoices in GSTR-1 or IFF can adversely affect the GST-registered recipients, causing a delay in claiming input tax credits. The CGST Rule 59(6) was notified vide the Central Tax notification number 1/2021 issued on 1st January 2021. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at annapoorna.m@cleartax.in\nAnnapoorna, popularly known as Anna, is an aspiring Chartered Accountant with a flair for GST.

This portal will maintain the National Database on Unorganised Workers (NDUW). It will bring millions of unorganised workers on one platform.\nThe Union Minister for Labour and Employment launched the logo of the e-Shram portal, aiming to register 38 crore unorganised workers in the country. The unorganised workers include the migrant workforce, construction labourers, domestic workers, street vendors, gig and platform workers, etc.\nAlong with the portal’s launch, the government will also launch a toll-free number – 14434 to address and assist with the workers’ queries of registration on the portal. The workers can register on the e-Shram portal shortly after its launch on the same day, i.e. 26 August 2021.\nThe workers can register using their Aadhaar card number and bank account details. They will also have to fill in the necessary information like home town, date of birth, social category and mobile number. The government will issue the workers an e-Shram card consisting of a 12 digit unique number. The state governments and departments will also share the details of the workers on the portal.\nThe objective behind launching the e-Shram portal is the integration of the social security schemes of the government. Identifying and collecting data on the unorganised workers in the country was a much-needed step since accurate data is unavailable. This portal will be the national database on unorganised workers and bring the welfare schemes to their doorstep.\nAll trade union leaders extended their support for the implementation and launch of the e-Shram portal. The Union Minister for Labour and Employment thanked the union leaders for providing constructive and valuable suggestions and emphasised that they have a significant role towards speedier implementation and registration at the field level and taking the portal to the unorganised workforce.\nThe launch of the e-Shram portal will ensure that the welfare schemes reach the beneficiaries at the right time across the country. The government can know the details of all unorganised workers in the country through the data on the e-Shram portal. It will help the government provide benefits of the social and welfare schemes to the unorganised workers in the country for their betterment.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at mayashree.acharya@cleartax.in\nI am an Advocate by profession.

        "data": "The Indian government is looking to share the CoWIN portal as a licensed product to countries for free until perpetuity. The chairperson of the Empowered Committee concerning the COVID-19 vaccine administration, Dr R.S. Sharma, mentioned that there would be a few conditions applicable for sharing the software with the interested countries. The software will not be permitted to be utilised as a platform for commercial purposes or repackaged to be sold.\nThe Central Government has received interest from about 76 countries so far. On 5th July, the government will conduct a virtual global conclave for health and technology experts worldwide. This conclave aims at demonstrating the software’s capabilities.\nFrom foreign countries, about 196 officials and 116 private individuals from 41 countries have registered to participate in the Global Conclave regarding CoWIN. In due course of time, the government is expected to have more information about which countries have formally displayed their interest in adopting the platform for vaccination-related needs in their respective countries.\nCoWIN has become India’s fastest-growing tech platform across the world. It has completed 20 crore registrations in the initial four months since its launch. As of 1 July, 35.4 crore individuals have registered themselves on the platform.  \nThe government is looking at refreshing the CoWIN application by introducing a few changes, including the linkage of passport numbers to the vaccination certificates concerning international travel. The other change consists of a new tab for editing personal details to allow hassle-free corrections in the vaccination certificates. This change is being done to help people who have submitted incorrect personal details such as name, gender, or date of birth in the process of registering themselves.\nTo facilitate a broader outreach for CoWIN, several consumer-facing apps have come onboard. The central government has already received more than 204 applications from public and private entities to integrate with CoWIN. Out of the 204 applications, 148 have been already accepted and are amidst completing their integrations.\nGoing forward, users will be able to access their vaccination certificates via CoWIN against their registered mobile number or a beneficiary reference ID. With this move, apps will provide options to a user to download their vaccination certificate. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The income tax department has launched a new e-filing portal, 2.0, on 7th June 2021.  \nThe link to the portal has also been updated from https://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/home to www.incometax.gov.in. \nThe new portal will have a single dashboard, which will provide specific benefits. Let us take you through the five must-know features introduced in the new portal by the department.\n1. Tutorials, guidance notes and videos\nThe landing page of the new portal has a tab with all the categories of the taxpayers, namely individual/HUF, company, non-company, tax professionals and others. The new portal has guidance notes related to ITR forms, tax slabs, and tax deductions applicable under the dropdown of each category of taxpayers. Thus, the new portal will have category-wise guidance and manuals for the taxpayers.   \nAlso, before login, under the section ‘Things to know’ on the landing page, the department has uploaded guidance videos related to income tax for the users. \n2. Pre-filled ITRs\nThe ITR utilities will be pre-filled with details like salary income, interest, dividend and capital gains once the concerned entity uploads TDS and SFT details. \nApart from this, the new portal allows the taxpayer to update their profile details. \nFor instance, in a salaried employee, details that need to be filled in are the employer’s name, PAN and TAN. \nIn the case of an individual earning an income from a house property, details like the address of the house property, rental income, and PAN are mandatory. \nThese details, once updated by the taxpayers, will be pre-filled in their ITR utility.\nPre-filling of ITRs will enable a simplified return filing process and also reduce tax evasion. \n3. Launch of the mobile app- \nThe new income tax portal will be available on mobile phones in the form of an app. This app will be available after the initial launch of the new portal to enable taxpayers to get used to the new features.\nAll the essential features of the income tax portal available on the desktop will also be available on the mobile app. \n4. Query resolution through a chatbot and call centre- \nThe chatbot/live agent will promptly assist taxpayers in filing their ITRs and help resolve various other income tax-related queries. The portal also extends digital assistance to taxpayers through various detailed FAQs, videos and user manuals.\nAlso, the new portal is all set to have a ‘new call centre’ for prompt resolution of the user’s queries. \n5. Tax payment facility- \nThe new portal now provides an income tax payment facility to the taxpayers, currently provided by the NSDL portal. The new payment system will be launched by 18th June 2021 to avoid inconvenience caused to taxpayers while paying the 1st instalment of the advance tax. The new system will provide taxpayers with various payment options such as UPI, credit card, RTGS/NEFT and net banking.\nWith the launch of the new portal, users are advised to re-register the DSC as the old ones are not migrated due to security issues. Also, they are advised to update the user ID and mobile number under primary contacts in their profile, link to Aadhaar and pre-validate bank account if not done previously and reset e-Filing Vault Higher Security Options.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at jyoti.arora@cleartax.in\nI am a Chartered Accountant by profession with  4+ years of experience in the finance domain.

        "data": "The income tax department has requested the online return filers to re-register the digital signature certificate (DSC) again on the new income tax filing portal that will be launched today. \nThe income tax department is revamping the entire e-filing portal by adding new user-friendly features and reducing the time taken for various income tax functionalities. The new portal is all set to be launched today, on 7th June 2021. \nThe communication from the department requested the income tax return filers to re-register the current DSC on the new portal https://www.incometax.gov.in starting from 7th June 2021. The portal will be live shortly, as tweeted by the income tax department. The department further stated that the earlier DSC registration of the old portal could not be migrated due to security and technical issues.\nA digital signature certificate or DSC is an electronic, physical certificate that validates the individual’s identity. While uploading any tax-related documents that need validation, DSC is used for online upload instead of a physical signature for signing documents electronically.\nFor example, a person furnishing the online ‘Income Tax Audit Report’ needs to attest it with a DSC for validation. DSC is generally issued for a validity period of 1 year based on the nature of the transactions and their uses. After the validity of DSC expires, users have to apply for its renewal. In case of any updates or change in personal information, a fresh DSC has to be applied. \nSo remember to go and re-register your DSC after the new portal gets live to have a hassle-free experience while uploading documents that require DSC attestation.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at jyoti.arora@cleartax.in\nI am a Chartered Accountant by profession with  4+ years of experience in the finance domain.

They provide that the four regulating entities have to formulate a policy for digital payment services and products with their board’s approval. The regulating entities need to review the policy periodically, at least once a year. \nThe directions also provide that wherever the regulating entities depend on third-party service providers, the regulating entities need to establish adequate controls for monitoring the third-party provider’s activity. They should have trained resources having the necessary expertise to manage the digital payment infrastructure.\nThe regulating entities should conduct risk assessment relating to digital payment products and services’ security and safety. The regulating entities’ internet banking application and mobile application should have adequate monitoring capabilities for tracking user activities, security changes, and identifying anomalous behaviour. \nThe regulating entities should also provide a mechanism for the customers to mark or identify a fraudulent transaction and send an immediate notification to the regulating entities.

        "data": "About 80% of toll collections made across national highways are via FASTag. Hence, not having FASTag for your vehicle might turn out to be inconvenient for you when you drive on national highways. Toll collection has already touched around Rs 93 crore per day, racing towards the mark of Rs 100 crore per day.\nFASTag is nothing but a tag or sticker which is usually pasted on a vehicle’s windscreen. FASTag, with the help of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, will communicate with the scanner installed at toll plazas. Once a vehicle crosses a toll plaza, the prescribed toll amount will automatically be deducted from a bank account or a prepaid wallet linked to the FASTag.\nThanks to FASTag! Vehicles need not have to stop at any toll plazas. In case the FASTag is linked to a prepaid account like a debit or a credit card, or a wallet, you will need to top up or recharge the tag. In case the FASTag is linked to a savings account, then the amount will get automatically deducted after the balance becomes lower than a predefined threshold. After your vehicle crosses the toll plaza, you will get an SMS alert regarding the deduction just like an SMS alert you receive when your money gets debited from your bank account or wallet.\nFASTags are available on all major online retail platforms such as Paytm, Amazon, Snapdeal etc. They have also been made available at points of sale locations set up by 23 banks. The list is inclusive of all major banks. Even the Road Transport Authority offices sell FASTags. The government is looking at ways to expand the network so that dealers, fuel stations, agents, and commercial centres are also covered and accessing a FASTag should be hassle-free. \nAlso Read: Will Contactless Banking Be the New Normal? Get Your Answer Here\nThe National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) via its subsidiary Indian Highway Management Company Limited (IHMCL) sells as well as operates FASTag. A FASTag which is purchased from one bank cannot be used with another bank’s account. So mostly, users choose to buy FASTag from a bank in which they have their bank accounts.\nNHAI also sells FASTags that are bank-neutral and are issued by IHMCL online; these FASTags are not linked to any bank, and a user can choose his/her mode of payment to be linked to his or her FASTag account. Currently, this type of FASTag is most popular. There are about 50 million vehicles; out of which there are about 20 million FASTag users. The FASTag user count has increased by 400% in a year. Last year, the number of FASTag users had not even touched the one crore mark. About 615 toll plazas of NHAI and 100 toll plazas of state highways have adopted toll collection via FASTag. This number will increase gradually.\nFor getting and activating a FASTag, you will need the following documents:\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

Currently, each state can make a decision voluntarily about what will be counted as online gambling and then decide whether to ban it or not — like how Tamil Nadu banned poker and rummy but not fantasy sports.\nIndustry experts believe that the Centre needs to clarify how the ‘gaming’ sector needs to be regulated. These days, these days operate via the internet increasingly and are regulated by the Centre. As it is difficult to handle the internet at a state level with various inter-state commerce and trade aspects involved, it would be ideal to have comprehensive guidelines or framework issued by the central government.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

        "data": "The COVID-19 pandemic and the physical distancing norms have changed the way we handle things. The same applies to retail payments as there are possibilities of the virus spreading through the currency notes when cash payments are made. This has led to more and more customers adopting contactless payment modes where they don’t have to pass their payments card or smartphone to the merchant. \nThough such payment instruments are nothing new, the growing fondness towards them is accelerating. The concept of ‘contactless’ banking is evolving with time, considerably in metro and tier-1 cities. The pandemic widened the horizons of this payment mode beyond the urban areas and digitally literate users.\nEven the non-digital type of individuals have started using the digital payment methods to make and receive payments, given the fear of the pandemic. Going forward, the trend of switching and relying on digital payments is expected to sustain and extend its reach even after the virus scare settles. \nContactless Banking is Not Just Contactless Payments\nYou might have misunderstood the concept of ‘Contactless Banking’ to be confined to contactless/digital payments. There is more to it! Banks have extensively adopted technology to their workflow and have come up with new ways of dealing with the customers at every point of interaction. \nWhether you have heard of it or not, there are concepts, such as video banking where people can open a bank account virtually by completing a few simple steps. Internally, the bank performs an end-to-end virtual verification regarding the applicant in just a few minutes and completes the process. Further, banks are providing Virtual Relationship Managers to customers so the customers can be successfully engaged and served.\nBesides, banks also offer services, such as SMS banking, mobile banking, phone banking, chatbot, missed call banking, and WhatsApp banking, to help enhance the customer experience in accessing the banking services. Banks are making use of technology to provide a customised experience to customers. \nAlso Read: Digital EMIs Witnesses Traction in New Segments\nA Rise in Contactless Payments\nCOVID-19 forced customers to look for alternate ways of banking rather than visiting the bank branch directly. A surge was observed in the usage of the technology-led banking services over the period of 6-7 months starting March 2020. The major reason for this hike in contactless payments is that the user need not touch any public surface and can make payments through their contactless debit and credit cards or their smartphones, i.e. UPI and mobile banking apps. \nOnce the customers get the taste of using such services and its ease, they wouldn’t want to turn back and switch to the offline method even in the upcoming days. The pandemic can be seen as a much-required stimulus for people to choose branchless banking services.\nSupport from RBI\nReserve Bank of India (RBI) has been encouraging contactless payments and, in turn, contactless banking through its move of doubling the limits for contactless cards. Though the limits are subjected to the discretion of the user, RBI has extended the limits for contactless card transactions and e-mandates for recurring transactions via UPI and cards up to Rs.5,000 from the initial Rs.2,000. This extension is effective from 1 January 2021.\nOn the business front, contactless payments and UPI come with the benefit of a lighter infrastructure and safety. Such features make it easier for the businesses to adopt; the adoption rate, both by customers and businesses, has also been high.\nAre you up for the adoption of contactless payments? How do you think of contactless banking being the new normal in the days to come? Can India become the cashless, contactless economy that it is trying to become?

        "headline": "7 Gadgets and Accessories You Need for a Hassle-free WFH Experience",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The COVID-19 pandemic has left us with a lot of lessons to learn. One such lesson it has taught us is to be productive while working from home. Amidst the pandemic, a home office has become an essential component of most Indian urban households.\nWork from home (WFH) is no doubt a blessing to most of us since we are still in a position to work and earn a living; unlike a lot of other people. Though WFH sounded exciting in the beginning, it’s slowly becoming an uncomfortable routine, which most people are eagerly waiting to get out of.\nIn this article, let’s see what gadgets and accessories could help in elevating your WFH experience to another level.\nA Wi-Fi router will be the first on the list to make your WFH experience smooth. Yes, you could rely on a mobile hotspot for accessing the internet; however, it’s better to have a dedicated broadband service when you are working from home for long hours for uninterrupted internet connectivity. \nA robust internet connection will ensure your work is done on time; a good router will make sure you get ample internet connectivity in various areas across your home.\nMulti-port wall chargers will help you in charging several gadgets at the same time. When you are using two phones, a laptop, a Bluetooth headphones/earphones, and a smartwatch you intend to charge without using different chargers, a multi-port charger is your go-to option.\nOur comfortable office chairs are one thing most of us are missing in our WFH days. Our office chairs provided our backs with complete support and did not disturb our body posture. We have realised that the regular chairs we use in our homes are not suitable for sedentary work structure or long hours of sitting.\nHere are a few features you need to look at when you are planning to buy an office chair:\nIt’s the right time for you to invest in a wireless mouse and a keyboard of good quality since we don’t know how long this lockdown would last! Also, since many companies are planning to shift to WFH culture to save space and their rent expenses, your investment will not get wasted even in the long run. You can also invest in a mouse pad which has a wrist rest so that you refrain from developing Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). \nAlso Read: Break the cycle of burnout with a break. Here’s how!\nGood lighting is essential for you to have a good WFH experience.  The lighting in your home office space can help you in increasing your productivity. When the lighting is low, it can dampen your energy, increase strain on your eyes, resulting in headaches, and ultimately it will bring down your ability to work effectively.\nWe are mostly relying on natural lighting, regular tubes, and LEDs for lighting up our home offices. In case there is not much natural light in your home, then artificial lights become more important to illuminate your home workspace. You could consider buying smart lights and bulbs, which are either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi enabled. Custom lighting options will prevent eye strain to a great extent. Also, smart lighting options will add colour and personalise your workspace where you’re spending a good lot of time of your day.\nAmidst this entire WFH scenario, the topmost priority for most of us is to be always connected with our team members and attend regular team meetings without any hassle. To stay connected with your teammates, you must have a high-quality headphone set or earphones. Most of you might already have a pair of good headphones or earphones.\nYou could also consider buying a good set of noise-cancelling earphones or headphones as you can get rid of background disturbances to a great extent during your calls. Another option you could consider buying would be Bluetooth earphones/headphones so that you aren’t confined to the same place throughout your working day, and you can easily move around your home.\nA few of the laptops get hot after using it for a long duration; as a safety measure, it is better to use a laptop cooling pad. This will not help in keeping the laptop cool; it will also work as a stand to keep your laptop inclined to facilitate better ergonomics. It will lessen the stress on your neck.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

This test will make the at-home diagnosis of the coronavirus infection a reality. This multiplexed test will access small volumes of blood or saliva with the help of a low-cost sensor.\nPreviously, the Caltech researchers developed wireless sensors which were made of graphene – which could detect conditions such as gout by accessing low levels of particular compounds in saliva, blood, or sweat. As per the study, the graphene structures are combined with antibodies – immune system molecules which are sensitive to particular proteins like those which are found on the surface of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).\nThe revised version of the sensor has been named as SARS-CoV-2 RapidPlex. This sensor comprises proteins and antibodies, which allows it to check if the novel coronavirus is present.  The current testing technologies for COVID-19 take hours or sometimes even days to give the test results; also needs complicated and expensive equipment. On the contrary, researchers believe that the new system is not only simple, but it is compact also.\nAlso Read: Government Warns Citizens About Fake Oximeter Apps\nSo far, scientists have tested the device only in the laboratory with a small number of saliva and blood samples which are obtained for medical research-related reasons from people who have tested either positive or negative for coronavirus.\nThe preliminary observations have shown that the new sensor is accurate in producing the results. However, conducting tests on a larger scale with more number of real-time patients has to be performed to confirm its accuracy definitively.\nResearchers now intend to test and see how long a sensor would last after regular usage.

        "data": "There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the healthcare sector worldwide. Along with disrupting the healthcare system, it has also disturbed the economy across the world. Due to the pandemic, small businesses are struggling to survive. Also, small businesses have been severely impacted with factors such as liquidity crunch, slack in demand because of pay cuts and job losses, disrupted supply chain, subsequent lockdowns, and lack of labour and funding.\nMSMEs are also facing the wrath of high taxation, interest payments, and loan repayments. Several small businesses are struggling to keep their businesses operational, while a few have already discontinued their supplies and services due to the drastic slowdown in the economy.\nIn order to facilitate the revival of MSMEs, several relief measures have been announced by the government. One such measure is collateral-free loans worth Rs 3 lakh crore which is backed in terms of both the principal as well as the interest by the government. With this measure, MSMEs are able to seek credit support from the banks with ease.\nApart from the reforms introduced by the government, technology also can assist MSMEs with the necessary resources and opportunities in order to acknowledge the new normal. In this article, let’s look at how technology can help small businesses revive in India.\nAmidst the pandemic, India has witnessed tremendous growth of digitalised payments, with more and more number of people opting for contactless payments in order to follow the social distancing norms. Hence, this is the right time for lending channels to either collaborate with appropriate fintech platforms or make an investment in the digital transformation of small businesses so that MSMEs can stay competitive.\nAdvances in technology can surely help in facilitating the ease of doing business for small businesses. Also, the government needs to look at adding more guarantee-based programs as well as a liquidity boost to MSMEs who are currently facing severe liquidity problems.\nAlso Read: Google Pay Introduces the NFC-Based Card Payments Option in India\nIn order to evaluate the creditworthiness of MSMEs in an efficient way, lenders have to use advanced technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) based cash flow analysis. This analysis will assist them in differentiating cash flows from the pre and post COVID times better. This will also make the overall loan application process, including the disbursal process more efficient as it reduces the paperwork to a large extent.\nIt will also safeguard the interests of lenders and bring down the rate of delinquency by rendering easy access to credit to businesses which are badly in need of it. Particularly, this will help MSMEs which struggle to get credit from the formal lending institutions such as banks.\nLenders can deploy solutions such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML in order to get insights such as loan repayment behaviour, cash flow forecasts, digital payment behaviour, etc. concerning borrowers, particularly who do not have a formal credit score.\nWith the aid of technology, financial institutions will be able to revamp the cumbersome loan application process of yesteryears. Banks can digitalise the complete loan sanctioning process. Innovative tech-enabled solutions can assist in automating the risk assessment of MSMEs, thereby speeding up the lending processes to a large extent.\nDigital advancements combined with policy reforms can help MSMEs revive from the severe economic crisis the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in.

        "headline": "How Effective Can Online Education Turn Out in India?",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The COVID-19 spread has affected every segment of society in various ways. Students have been fighting their own battle since schools and colleges have not been operating as usual. From the far end, it may look like a relief or vacation period for students. However, many class 10 and 12 students had to spend the lockdown period in a fix whether to study for the exams that they are uncertain of, to spend time with their families, or to manage their mental health of the sudden hit of the pandemic.\nThe government did not want the students to waste time and was too scared to re-open the schools/colleges. An alternative the government thought of was online classes. A lot of debate happened over the matter, and still online classes have been the new norm. \nI would always wonder what and how they would teach a kindergarten class kid through online classes as I believe kids cannot stay at one place for hours looking at the screen nor will they attentively listen to anything that is being said by their teacher virtually. Not just that, several middle class and lower-middle-class people are living in rural India who can afford the high-speed internet required for online courses or even a smartphone. Also, many rural areas are not connected to the world wide web.\nAccording to the Economist’s survey, Jan 2018, the size of the middle-class population in India is estimated to be 78 million out of the total population of 1,352.6 million people. Another survey by Krishnan and Hatekar, EPW June 2017 states that 604 million citizens of India belong to the middle class. It may seem a small percentage; however, the number is enormous. \nIn addition, a UNICEF report states that only 24% of Indian households have access to internet connections to support online education.\nAlso Read: HRD Issues Guidelines For Online Classes, Suggests Cap on Screen Time\nThe statistics show that online education is only accessible for high-income groups and the current situation of online classes have created a massive gap across the high, medium, and low-income groups. The credits for this issue goes to the large rural-urban and gender divide the report mentions. Thanks to the unequal and unfair opportunities across the various income groups, children from economically disadvantaged families cannot access remote learning.\nThe report also expressed that girls from the most marginalised communities have no access to smartphones. Even if they do, the poor internet connections and the lack of quality content in the regional languages have contributed to distress. COVID-19 has shut down over 1.5 million schools across the country affecting 286 million children from the pre-primary to secondary levels of which 49% constitute girls. \nThough the Centre and the state governments have come up with several initiatives, including the digital and non-digital platforms so that the students continue learning from home, the digital divide has prevailed. \nAt a time when the parents are out of work and struggling to find money to feed their families, the lack of window to access online classes, like their peers from high-income groups, has increased discomfort to many children. Recently, there are headlines every other day in the newspaper, such as ‘Unable to get a smartphone for online classes, girl commits suicide’, ‘Girl without smartphone fails to attend online classes, kills self’, and ‘Class 10 girl dies by suicide as poor parents fail to buy a smartphone for online classes’. This is heartbreaking!\nIn another case, even when children have access to the required technology and gadgets, there may not be the right environment for them to focus on learning. Though all these fusses are temporary as the saying goes, ‘This too shall pass’, children at their young age fail to recognise the nature of the situation and make hasty judgements, which may lead to events that cannot be turned back.\nInstead of accepting the defeat, people with social awareness must come together to look at the issue at hand from a different perspective and solve it. For example, a zari artisan who lost all his orders from the lockdown took the help of his colleagues to set up a library in a village located 50km from Kolkata. The initiative was to help students of the village who cannot afford online classes to continue with their learning process. \nUNICEF, however, recommends the government to prioritise safe re-opening of the schools. It also urged the government to arrange for compensatory learning for the lost time. Also, the children’s fund has also suggested that educational institutions must make arrangements to be able to adapt to the situation and be ready to face and withstand any future crises.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at apoorva.n@cleartax.in"

        "data": "To secure cheque payments, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has introduced the Positive Pay mechanism. Positive Pay is a cash-management service which is automated. It is employed to prevent cheque fraud. Any cheque which seems to be suspicious will be sent back to the issuer for examination. The Positive Pay mechanism acts like insurance for a company by saving it from losses, fraud, and other liabilities; it will also make cheque payments safer. \nAn issuer can send all his/her details to the bank due to which the clearance of cheques happens faster. The Positive Pay system will apply to cheques valuing Rs 50,000 and above. Every cheque will be processed according to the information given by an account holder at the time of issuing the cheque. As per the central regulator, this initiative is expected to cover 20% of total cheque transactions by volume and 80% by value.\nThe Positive Pay mechanism works by making sure that every cheque that is valued at Rs 50,000 and above is verified with the details rendered by an issuing party or an individual. Only when there is a match, it will result in a drawee’s bank clearing the cheque. In case it is a ‘no match’ scenario, the cheque issuer will be contacted for further verification.\nUnder this new system, an account holder will need to electronically upload the details of cheque via a bank’s net banking system.\nA customer will need to enter the cheque number, date of issuance, account number, payee name, amount payable, and the image of the front and backside of cheque on the Positive Pay system. Later, the cheque can be given to the concerned beneficiary.\nAlso Read: PM Announces Health ID Card to Be Issued for All Citizens\nThe cheque is then submitted at the beneficiary’s bank for encashment and forwarded to the drawee’s bank for clearance. The drawee bank will then compare the information mentioned on the cheque, along with the information provided online by a customer via the Positive Pay system. In case all the details match, the cheque will be honoured.\nRBI will soon be releasing the guidelines for the Positive Pay system. The participating banks, as well as customers, will need to adhere to the guidelines.

        "headline": "Courts Hearing Cases Online Due to Pandemic Situation",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The traditional hearing of cases is changing in these tough times. The courts are hearing arguments of cases online due to lockdown in the country. Many institutions and companies have changed their working style due to COVID-19 situation. The courts in India have also changed their working style due to the present condition. This change occurred due to the prolonged lockdown in the country. The courts could not be closed for too many days. The cases started piling up, and urgent matters had to be taken up and addressed. Thus, the courts started digitalisation of its procedures.\nJudges started hearing urgent matters through video conferencing. With hearing cases, filing procedures also started online. Development of e-filing took place to file cases before High Courts and District Courts. Advocate filed applications and written arguments online. A copy of this is given to the opposite advocate online. All courts in the country started adapting to the digitalisation of court procedures.\nHearing of arguments in all the courts is by video conferencing. The advocates connect to the concerned judges before whom their cases are filed, from their homes and argue cases at the given time. The opposite advocates also join at the given time to hear the arguments. Thus, the hearing of cases takes place online.\nThe courts in India have incorporated e-courts through the Integrated Mission Mode Project (E-Courts Project) as part of the National eGovernance Plan (NeGP) formulated by the Government of India. E-courts provide for filing of cases online in all High Courts and District Courts of India through e-filing option. \nAdvocates have to register to ‘E-Courts Services’ website to file cases online by providing their details. Certified copies of the applications filed by the opposite advocate in a case are got online through this website. Court fee is paid on this website while filing new cases. The e-filling option enables the police stations across India to e-file charge sheets and papers relating to criminal cases.\nThe Government of India maintains the e-courts services website, which helps courts to digitalise procedures. While filings take place here, the question of security of data comes up. It has to be adequately maintained to protect essential data. The government has taken care to protect data by providing an encrypted password to the user and industry-standard measures to safeguard information. \nAlso Read: e-Passports: Another Step Towards a Total Digital Economy\nLaw and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad stated that “The e-filing process in the Supreme Court has made it easy to file cases. During the lockdown period, 640 advocates on record have registered for e-filing cases in Supreme Court. This is a move towards digitisation of the judicial process.” His statement shows that the courts and advocates of the country are welcoming and accepting digitalisation of courts.\nThe digitalisation provides for a new way of the working of courts. The traditional system was followed for a long time without making use of present technology in the courts until now. With the arrival of COVID-19 and lockdown, courts and advocates had to shift to technological ways and bring change in the working of courts. Due to digitalisation, advocates need not travel long distances to courts. It helps in saving time for the advocates and litigants.\nAs time is fixed for hearing cases, the litigants and the advocates can connect at that time without coming and waiting the whole day at court premises. It helps in reducing the crowds in the courts. There is a reduction in the use of a lot of papers, as e-filing is facilitated. Huge documents in the case files are prevented as these documents are stored digitally in data form. \nWhile digitalising court procedures has a lot of pros, it doesn’t come without cons. There are interruptions during video conferencing due to internet connectivity. Courts have to maintain proper servers and high-speed internet to facilitate video calls. Similarly, advocates should have correct connectivity. There is a problem for fixing time for calls as it has to match the schedule of judges, advocates and litigants. Since every document and information is uploaded online, there is a need for high protection of data. Security of data should be rigorous. Website maintenance is essential. The status of applications and cases filed should be updated regularly. \nThe digitalisation of courts is slowly picking up the pace in the country. While many are supporting for digitalisation to continue after COVID-19 times, many still doubt its working. The e-courts project is in Stage II, and Stage III is yet to take place. The pandemic situation has brought technology to the court environment. Digitalisation is a profound change, and there is much to be developed for efficient and proper implementation. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at mayashree.acharya@cleartax.in\nI am an Advocate by profession.

        "data": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruption in most of the economic activities due to which businesses across the world are suffering. There has been a tremendous increase in scams and frauds related to COVID-19 in the country. Hackers are taking advantage of the situation to lure potential consumers into downloading infected files via suspicious links. Criminals are trying to misuse high volume searches and interest amongst the public to know any information related to coronavirus on the internet. \nThe pandemic has compelled consumers to use digital payments. As social distancing is becoming the new norm in the era of COVID-19, consumers are being forced to opt for digital and contactless modes of payments. However, with the increased usage of online payments, comes the fear of frauds related to such payments. Thanks to the pandemic! Almost everyone nowadays is preferring to use a digital medium to make their payments.\nThe question that’s left for most of us now is if these digital payment options are safe to use considering how active hackers and fraudsters have become in times of COVID-19.\nIn this article, let’s talk about the various COVID-19 related scams and frauds we have seen so far and also the potential scams we could altogether avoid in the days to come.\nRecently, an app which claimed to check an individual’s oxygen, BP, and sugar levels via his or her phone compelled users to use their thumb or fingers for verification. However, later it was identified as a fake app which was used to copy the thumb and finger impressions of users since the impressions were directly linked to the user’s Aadhaar and bank account. Many innocent people lost money from their bank accounts.\nFraudsters are creating and manipulating several other mobile phone apps. These apps look like they are meant for tracking the spread of COVID-19. Nevertheless, in reality, once these apps are installed, a user’s device will get affected with malware which can be used for obtaining the user’s personal information, bank account/card details, sensitive data, etc.\nThere has been a substantial increase in new fraud risk typologies, specifically about the registration of significant numbers of ‘COVID-19’ internet domains. These websites pose like genuine websites of an organisation; however, they are fake and carry the essential malware to infect electronic devices such as computers, phones, laptops, iPads, etc.\nSince most of the companies have opted for the Work From Home (WFH) option, fraudsters are using this as an opportunity to target various companies and their employees. With the help of emails disguised as updates related to COVID-19, fraudsters are tricking employees into submitting their credentials by requesting them to log in to a company’s ”COVID-19” portal, which is fake. Once an employee enters his/her credentials, a fraudster can have uninterrupted access to the business accounts and network of an organisation an employee is working at.\nAlso Read: Are COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps as Effective as They Claim?\nPeople are not able to differentiate between genuine and fake drugs. Since there is a significant gap between the demand and supply of essential drugs, people are falling prey to counterfeit drugs which are being stuffed on the online marketplace and even in the pharmacies. Fraudsters are also using online and social media forums to promote fake testing kits, products, masks, sanitisers, vaccines, and unproven treatment methods.\nNevertheless, the fake branch was identified when an SBI customer enquired regarding the newly-opened branch with the manager of an existing branch in the town.\nIn this article, we understood how fraudsters are using the entire pandemic situation for their benefit and are cheating innocent people. We should aim at making digitalisation safe for both consumers and merchants. Gradually, we should aim at adopting cutting-edge technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and biometric authentication to combat such frauds. COVID-19 could be a blessing in disguise for enhancing the overall scope of the digital payment space.\nIn the days to come, we need to focus on developing top-notch security systems which can eliminate all kinds of frauds/scams thus ensuring a safer digital payment space in the post-COVID-19 era.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

If you happen to apply for a new or renewal of passport in 2021, you could get an e-passport, i.e. a passport embedded with a microprocessor chip.\nThe government has issued about 20,000 of these e-passports on a trial basis. They were issued only from the CPV division at the headquarters of the Ministry of External Affairs for official and diplomatic passports. Now, the government has begun the process of issuing e-passports for all citizens and is on the lookout for an agency to manage the process effectively. \nOn the official front, the National Informatics Centre and the Ministry of External Affairs have been working together and have issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) to select an agency to handle the set up of IT infrastructure and solution for personalising the e-passports.\nIt is said that the microprocessor embedded in the passport will make things difficult for those who try to forge and facilitate the quicker immigration process for international passengers. Over the trial period, the e-passports issued are personalised and printed on the booklets.\nThe IT infrastructure required for offering e-passports is said to be dedicated with a capacity to issue 10,000 to 20,000 e-passports per hour. As of now, it is proposed to set up the IT systems in New Delhi and Chennai. \nAlso Read: AutoPay Feature is Now Available for Recurring Payments Via UPI\nThere are 36 passport offices located across the country and all of these offices will be issuing e-passport once the personalisation system is added to the current passport issuance system. In addition, the e-passports are made inline with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standard in order to ensure interoperability without conflicts among different countries.\nIt is essential to install the new system in place without causing any trouble to the existing system. Also, it is assured that there will be no increase in the time required to issue a passport even during the installation period. \nThe government has clarified that the IT system to be set up at the data centres located in New Delhi and Chennai will handle any additional load that is generated from the e-passport infrastructure. This is because the e-passport issuance system is looking at a target output of 10,000 e-passports per hour and 50,000 per day. The target output may be scaled up to 20,000 per hour and one lakh per day.\nAre you excited about the e-passport initiative?

        "headline": "Role of Technology in the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Technology will not be able to avoid the onset of a pandemic; nevertheless, it can assist in managing a crisis more effectively. We all know how badly COVID-19 has impacted our lives, both personal and professional. During this time of sheer uncertainty and constant fear, our willingness to adopt technology has been our lifeline. \nLet’s take a look at how technology has impacted our lives in the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n1. Distance Learning\nAccording to a recent survey, around 191 countries have either implemented or announced the closure of schools and universities, which has directly impacted close to 1.57 billion students. Most of the educational institutions have started to offer their courses online to make sure education is not disrupted due to the pandemic. Technologies used in distant learning include augmented reality, 3D printing, virtual reality, and robot teachers enabled with artificial intelligence.\n2. Online Entertainment \nCOVID-19 has completely transitioned how content is being generated, distributed, and streamed. Online streaming of live shows and concerts have gained traction across the world. Several film production companies have also been releasing their movies via Over The Top (OTT) platforms such as Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, Netflix, Zee5, Voot Select, etc. OTT caters to varied interests of people across the globe with the perennial additions of diverse content. \nThe lockdown has helped people in realising the ease of viewing content on OTT platforms; it has changed how people are consuming content on a day-to-day basis.  OTT platforms have witnessed a significant rise in both app downloads and viewership during the lockdown period. \nMany gaming platforms have witnessed substantial growth in their user base. There has been a significant spike in the gaming sector’s sales and the duration for which the games are being played. People are using gaming as an option to deal with COVID-19 stress.  \n3. Contact Tracing Applications\nContact tracing apps like Aarogya Setu have assisted in tracking the COVID-19 spread. Technology has also helped in educating people about the entire situation and reminding them to take the necessary precautions. Telecom operators such as BSNL, Jio, Airtel, etc. have used caller tunes for spreading awareness about the pandemic.\nThe facial recognition technology has helped in identifying people accurately even when they are wearing a mask. Technology has also helped in monitoring the movement of quarantined people. CCTV cameras which are enabled with facial recognition feature have helped in identifying infected individuals who do not follow the rules and step out of their homes despite being quarantined.\n4. Stock Market\nThe adoption of technology in the stock market industry has been quite good for brokerage firms. Several brokerage companies have seen a spike in the number of clients since more investors have decided to tap the stock market. Due to the pandemic, clients are mostly staying indoors and are getting more free time to access the market situation, thereby also leading to an increase in trading volumes. \n5. Contactless Online Deliveries\nThe online grocery market witnessed tremendous growth during the pandemic due to the soaring demand amongst consumers. Families, particularly with children and older people, preferred to place their grocery orders online. This, in turn, resulted in a significant increase of new users who are resorting to online apps for grocery deliveries. The provision given to choose a preferred time slot for delivery plus a reduced delivery fee for orders above a specified amount is attracting more and more customers towards online delivery business models.\nAlso Read: Are COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps as Effective as They Claim?\n6. Robotics\nCOVID-19 has made us realise how meaningful human interactions are for making things work. The pandemic has severely impacted labour-intensive sectors such as food, retail, logistics, and manufacturing businesses. COVID-19 has resulted in a strong push to implement the usage of robots and also to speed up the robotics research. Robots are now being used to clean infected areas and for delivering food to quarantined individuals.\nThe count of COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly, and the number of patients who need medical attention is putting extraordinary pressure on healthcare professionals across the world. In a few countries, remote-controlled robots are being used for helping medical professionals to conduct critical tasks such as mouth swab collection for conducting the virus detection test, for conducting ultrasound scans, etc.\nDrones are being used for food deliveries, tracking population, transporting test kits, spraying disinfectant, and for delivering medicines to quarantine areas, etc.\n7. Dissemination of Information\nCompanies such as Google, Facebook, are striving hard to ensure people get only accurate and verified information. Their objective is to make accurate information accessible to everyone so that there is complete transparency of the entire scenario, and people can be educated about the required steps to undertake well in advance.\nFalse information around the number of COVID-19 cases, vaccines, diagnosis and treatment options, medicines, government measures, etc., can create more panic among the population. The anxiety of people could result in widespread chaos, hoarding of essential items, panic buying, increased rates, conspiracy theories, etc.\n8. Fitness & Health Apps\nNew alternatives are being introduced by health and fitness apps to help people remain fit at the comfort of staying indoors due to the pandemic situation. Several fitness and health brands have started conducting live workout sessions on their apps and social media platforms. These initiatives have also seen decent traction.\n9. Technology-Based Temperature Monitoring\nInfrared and wireless thermometers have now become the most commonly used medical equipment at toll gates, entry and exit gates of offices, airports, shopping malls, hotels, railway stations, shops, hospitals, and other public places. These temperature monitoring technologies have assisted in measuring the body temperature of individuals from a distance; these temperature measuring devices have also been useful in identifying the individuals who might need further investigation.\n10. Work From Home (WFH)\nThe work from home option has ensured business continuity for various companies and businesses. Internet, data privacy security, virtual meetings, cloud conferencing, etc. have assisted professionals in adapting themselves to work from the home scenario with ease. WFH has also ensured that the deliverables are not delayed. Remote working has been a blessing in disguise, which has helped us to a great extent to maintain and follow social distancing protocols.\nA Final Note\nCOVID-19 has proved that technology innovations have been helping in managing the epidemic in a timely, systematic, and calm manner. A lesson learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic has been to stay prepared well in advance against any crisis at both an individual and collective level. All we need to fight an epidemic like COVID-19 is preparedness. Advancement in technology is steadily progressing; it will undoubtedly continue to grow exponentially. It’s we humans who have to adapt to changes in technology faster and continue to invest in building the technology systems for better preparedness.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "With an aim to track and stop the spread of coronavirus, a vast range of digital technologies is being used. One of these technologies includes surveillance technology.\nYes, a surveillance system is capable of mapping the movements of an entire population using the signals which are emitted by the smartphones we use. There are also drones which are being used to send audio warnings to individuals who are not complying to the social distancing-related guidelines. \nThen we have cameras enabled with facial recognition using infrared technology which can detect if an individual’s body temperature is above normal. We also have several applications which can be installed on our smartphones; it will indicate whether we have come in contact with an infected person.\nThere is no doubt about the striking potential surveillance technology has; it could be of help to societies which are recovering from COVID-19. Nevertheless, there has been a lot of debate concerning its usage. A certain percentage of the population fears that the government might use the pandemic situation to enable wide-ranging intrusive powers that would allow them to pry into the private lives of people.\nAlso Read: Are COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps as Effective as They Claim?\nA group of 130+ human rights groups in April released a letter warning against the extension of surveillance powers in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The letter mentioned that the states cannot just overlook rights such as privacy and freedom of expression in the context of tackling the public health crisis.\nAlso, this concern isn’t fictional; a few governments have already exploited the COVID-19 crisis to remain in power and are introducing measures which could be mishandled to intimidate political opponents. Even in case, people accept privacy risk as a cost worth paying; doubts persist about how effective surveillance can be as a tool in fighting against the deadly coronavirus.\nThe various approaches governments are undertaking are entirely new. It might take years before we witness the results. In a few countries, digital surveillance systems will render useful insights, assisting epidemiologists in understanding the virus spread better. Meanwhile, other countries might use the moment to broaden the reach of invasive technology. The results of the various steps initiated by several countries are likely to leave a legacy behind for the generations to come.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Contact tracing apps which use GPS and Bluetooth are surely helping the authorities in tracking the COVID-19 spread; however, are they as effective as they claim? This is something that we need to think about.\nAccording to experts, a contact tracing app could help in stopping the spread of the coronavirus only if 80% of the smartphone users download the app. Also, a recent study declared that broad adoption of a contact tracing app and the speed of usage are two critical factors which help in stopping the spread of the virus.\nDevelopers and researchers across the world have been in a race to design protocols which can gain public trust and result in wide adoption. They’ve also been receiving ample support from the technology giants such as Google and Apple. They are in the process of introducing a common platform via an operating-system update which has received a lot of praises from the cryptographers. Nevertheless, it is not guaranteed that a contact tracing app will function as intended to help in reducing the spread of COVID-19.\nAlso Read: India’s Healthtech Market Expected to Hit $21 billion by 2025\nApart from privacy concerns, there is another practical challenge that needs to be dealt with when we talk about these apps, i.e. the accurate measurements which need to be made of how close two devices are. There can be variation in signal strength based on the orientation of the phone and depends on whether the phone is in a person’s hand or his/her pocket. Also, the other challenge is to ensure enough people download these apps to make it as effective as they claim. \nExperts believe that an app which is based on symptoms could make a massive difference in stopping the virus spread instead of waiting for the test results. Introducing contact tracing apps based on symptoms makes more sense epidemiologically since it will be quick to reach people before they transmit the virus.\nWith the help of interventions such as persistent shielding of vulnerable individuals and community testing, contact tracing apps can help in preventing COVID-19 from rapidly re-emerging.\nTo save lives, to bring down the number of individuals in self-isolation, and to support as many people as possible, we need to aim at combining these apps with ethical principles and vital epidemiological parameters.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The Exposure Notification solution which was launched last month is now being rolled out on Android and iPhone devices in India. Google and Apple developed this technology. It is an Application Program Interface (API), which allows contact-tracing applications built by public health agencies and governments to work efficiently.\nApple and Google have created a set of privacy guidelines in which contact-tracing device applications are expected to agree on the terms and conditions imposed by organisations, particularly those relating to privacy, should the developers intend to add additional functionality and features to their apps. These set of terms and conditions allow users to clearly and explicitly opt-in to utilise technology, to avoid the collection or processing of location data from the device, etc.\nAs per the information published by Google, access to the Exposure Notification will be given only to apps developed by public health authorities. The apps should comply with specific criteria concerning security, data use, and privacy.\nEvery Exposure Notification matching will happen on a user’s device, which implies that only the user and his app will know if he/she has reported having COVID-19 or has been exposed to someone who reported having COVID-19. The user’s identity will not be shared with other users, Google, or Apple.\nAlso Read: Facebook To Provide More Context on Posts Related to COVID-19\nIf the user decides to use the Exposure Notification solution, the programme will create a random ID for a user’s device, thus ensuring that these random IDs are updated every 10-20 minutes so that they cannot be used to identify the user or his/her location. The user’s device and the other phones in the vicinity would then function in the background to share these random IDs via Bluetooth without the need for the device to be opened for this process to take place.\nThe phone will then regularly search all random IDs that are related to positive COVID-19 cases against its list; if there is a match, the device will contact the user with guidance from the relevant public health authority.\nFor making the Aarogya Setu app compatible with the solution, a few tweaks have to be done in the app. For example, the Exposure Notification, by design, restricts the collection or use of device location data. The knowledge sharing protocol concerning the Aarogya Setu app allows location and contact data to be collected to implement or formulate required health responses.\nThe Aarogya Setu app, India’s contact-tracing platform is not compliant with the Exposure Notification solution. In response to a question asked whether Aarogya Setu would be modified to fulfil the criteria for the programme, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology mentioned that Google had not taken a decision yet. Many countries have adopted the technology in Europe such as Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Poland, etc. with several of them creating their contact-tracing apps based on the Exposure Notification protocols.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

        "data": "As per a media report, the government is contemplating a license fee cut for fixed-line broadband services in India. This change could bring down the cost of household broadband services and help service providers to expand their coverage area at a lower price.\nThe license fee concerning the AGR generated by broadband companies via households will be reduced to Rs.1 a year, according to the proposed plan. The projected license fee concerning fixed-line broadband services, measured at a rate of 8%, currently stands at Rs.880 crore per year, making this a significant improvement. The proposal in question is yet to be approved by the cabinet.\nAccording to the report, the new proposal will bring down the license fee based on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) generated by broadband companies for rendering internet connectivity to households in the country. As per the latest data provided by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), there are more than 1.98 crore fixed-line broadband subscribers in India.\nAlso Read: Why Moving to a Cloud-Based Software is the Need of the Hour!\nJio Fiber is one of the key beneficiaries which may reap benefits through the changes proposed as it formally launched its broadband services last year, but is currently facing massive competition from existing players, including ACT Fibernet and Airtel. Increased revenue potential through a license fee reduction will allow Jio Fiber to accelerate its broadband services in the country. \nThe report, quoting people who are familiar with the development, mentioned that there would be no changes in the services offered to commercial users. It is estimated that the proposed reform would result in a loss of Rs.592.7 crore to the government, however, at the same time would result in a rise of 10% in the revenues concerning broadband companies which are offering their services to households.\nApart from Jio, the reduced license fee, if approved, would benefit other prominent broadband service providers. ACT Fibernet, Airtel, and state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) will be able to increase their revenues and reduce acquisition costs through the changes announced.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

        "data": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected business practices in more ways than one could have imagined. With the government-ordered lockdown that was in place, economic activities were brought to a standstill. \nThe effect of this could last for a few years, and the practice of social distancing could mean that staying apart and working remotely will become the new norm. Labour-intensive organisations have to ensure that these rules are being strictly adhered to, as even the slightest violation could end up aiding the spread of the virus, rather than hindering it.\nIn light of the rising number of cases, companies who can afford to work remotely are continuing to do so. One such key business activity an enterprise can perform remotely is their accounting and taxation function. This is an activity which can be safely moved to a cloud-based system without affecting any of the other business activities or causing any untoward impact in the long-run.\nOne of the biggest advantages of using a cloud is the remote working option, where you can access data and work anywhere and at any time. A cloud-software is designed to get your business through any event that would otherwise prevent you or your employees from sitting in a physical office and doing your job. Not just remote working, it is a software that will enable your employees to work as a team, with a multi-user option. \nAlso Read: NHAI Goes ‘Fully Digital’ With Cloud-Based ‘Data Lake’ Software\nBesides these advantages, cloud software, in general, is known to be a far more cost-effective and user-friendly approach, as the enterprise will not need to download or install the software on each employee’s device. Software updates are dynamic and automatic, and data storage is never a hassle as all data gets saved directly on the cloud. Data is also secure, as most cloud companies give data security an utmost priority when designing and creating cloud-based software.\nFor tax professionals, even though the return filing due dates have been extended, GST and IT returns will still need to be eventually filed. This means that clients will need to visit your office and submit data, or you will need to send a team to your client’s office to obtain the data for tax filings. At a time like this, with most people trying to minimize the risk of catching the virus, nothing would be better than moving to the cloud, where just an email with your client’s data will be enough to carry out the entire tax compliance process.\nClearTax is one such firm to offer cloud-based accounting software, which provides a multidimensional solution ranging from invoicing to tax return filing, carried out completely using cloud technology. There are many such tax return filing and invoicing software in the market. When choosing good cloud-based accounting software, make sure you invest in one which carries out multiple functions. \nMany of them enable IT and GST return filing functions, but it would be advisable to buy one which can even generate invoices and reports. This will help you avoid needing to purchase different software for different tasks. Due to its plethora of advantages, moving to a cloud is not just the need of the hour, but a long-term solution in the making, for businesses and tax professionals.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in.\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

It is the first construction sector organisation which has become fully digital.\nThe entire NHAI project management process has now been converted from manual to an online interface, where the complete execution of the project operations including ‘workflow with schedules’ and ‘alert system’ have been designed. The authority has also mentioned that contract decisions, project documentation, and approvals are now being made via portal only.\nWith advanced research, the Data Lake software will predict delays, possible conflicts, and render warnings, thereby accelerating the process of decision-making. The software will also ease the process of making correct and timely decisions, as the system is likely to predict the financial impact of different alternatives on the basis of historical data.\nNHAI mentioned that it has a significant number of arbitration cases that are pending with a hefty amount of claims and counterclaims. Most of the conflicts are generic, such as transfer of facilities, delay in handing over a site which is free from encumbrances, idling charges concerning equipment, machinery, staff, and delay in decision making. \nAlso Read: Young Workforce of India Most Open to Adopting Digital Technology\nThese conflicts can be reduced with the help of the Data Lake software. The software is capable of tracking and monitoring all such constraints. It will also ensure that work is carried out in a transparent manner within the deadlines.\nSince all processes will be portal-based, the process of making decisions will be quicker and will ultimately reduce the chances of litigation in the future. \nAll NHAI stakeholders, including consultants, contractors, and independent engineers, are already using it extensively. All documents and correspondences related to the project will be stored in a digital format in a cloud-based ‘Data Lake’ which is connected to GIS tagging and a unique project ID. This will help in retrieving project-related data from any location whenever it is required. \nNHAI’s e-Office module has also been added into the system so that every correspondence can flow digitally from field units to headquarters in a secured manner. \nIn the present COVID-19 situation, while most of the companies are facing a lot of challenges to work, NHAI employees are continuing their work happily without the fear of physical contact or the need to touch physical files.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in.\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

The app will show appropriate updates from local transit agencies concerning public transit. Such warnings will help a user to plan accordingly when government regulations hinder transit systems or demand the user to wear a mask when he or she uses public transport. \nA transit alert will be released in Argentina, India, Belgium, Australia, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, France, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Thailand.\nIn case a user is using his or her car or a personal taxi, Google Maps will be providing driving alerts to notify regarding the restrictions and checkpoints along the road.

This layer renders efficient particle filtration, which is at par with a medical mask and an N95 respirator.\nAlso Read: Smartphone Shipments to Decline by 12% Globally Due to COVID-19\nThe Assistant Professor also mentioned that the nanofibres comply with the user’s safety requirements by barring infectious components and even the bacteria. The breathability factor is better in the developed masks in comparison to the commercially available masks. The mask’s material cost was about Rs 25 per mask at a laboratory scale; however, during the commercial stage of manufacturing the price will reduce almost to half of Rs 25 per piece.\nSumit Sinha Ray further explained that nanofibres are capable of doing wonders when it comes to masks. For efficient masks, breathability, as well as the airborne pollutant and particulate removal efficiency, are the two essential criteria. Masks which are made based on nanofibres are capable of filtering out minute particles efficiently, plus it also allows the person who is wearing the mask to breathe comfortably.\nThe research team also claimed that the masks would not need any separate protocol to be adhered to concerning the disposal of the mask. The standard hygiene measures have to be followed to dispose of the mask. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

        "data": "Smartphone shipments to dip by almost 12% in 2020 globally claims a market research firm IDC. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only affected the business supply chain networks with notable smartphone manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung reporting financial hits, but it also has limited consumer spending across the world.\nIncreasing unemployment and lockdowns nationwide have brought down confidence amongst the consumers and reprioritised their spending towards essential goods. This has directly impacted the sales of smartphones within a short period, said IDC ‘s senior research analyst, Sangeetika Srivastava.\nApple was compelled to shut down retail stores in Europe and the United States following the COVID-19 outbreak, and announced iPhone 11 discounts in China. Apple also launched a new low-priced iPhone SE model to meet the global demand for smartphones.\nAlso Read: Global Smartphone Sales Dip By 20% in Q1 2020 Due to COVID-19\nTrendForce, a research firm, mentioned in April that global smartphone production is expected to drop by 16.5% in the June quarter when compared to a year earlier. In the March quarter, there was a 10% decrease in the output worldwide when the coronavirus spread and the pandemic peaked in China before spreading through the United States and Europe. \nNevertheless, China’s factory shipments to vendors increased by 17% in April from the previous year, recommending signs of an early rebound concerning domestic demand within the world’s largest smartphone market. In China, where the economy has started to reopen, and factories have resumed activities, IDC anticipates a single-digit decline this year. \nThe research firm also anticipates the forthcoming 5G rollout to help restore smartphone shipments next year, adding that it does not expect the development to return until the first quarter of 2021.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

The demands of consumers deteriorated since they stopped spending on non-essential goods during the first quarter due to the complexities the pandemic caused.\nEach of the top five smartphone vendors reported a decline in the first quarter of 2020, except Xiaomi, which achieved a remarkable 1.4% growth. \nHigh sales of Redmi devices in international markets and strong online channel focus has led Xiaomi to achieve better than anticipated revenues, according to a study entitled “Market Share: PCs, Ultramobiles and Cell Phones, All Countries, 1Q20 Update.” \n“The coronavirus pandemic has caused the global smartphone market to witness the worst downturn ever,” said Anshul Gupta, the Senior Research Analyst at Gartner.\nMany of the leading Chinese manufacturers and Apple have been severely impacted by the temporary closure of their factories in China and decreased spending amongst consumers.\nAlso Read: Q1 Mobile Wallet Transactions Volume Dip By 4%: Worldline India\nEven though Samsung’s smartphone sales decreased by 22.7% in the first quarter of 2020, the company remained No. 1 with a market share of 18.5%. COVID-19 adversely affected Samsung’s smartphone sales throughout the quarter. \nSince Samsung has a limited presence in China and the location of its manufacturing facilities are out of China, a sharp decline has been avoided. The decrease could have been worse otherwise.\nHuawei indicated the worst performance amongst the top 5 global smartphone vendors during the first quarter of 2020. Sales of Huawei’s smartphones dropped to 42.5 million units, slipped to 27.3% year on year. Even with the first-ever drop in smartphone sales, Huawei remained No. 2 with a market share of 14.2%. \nHuawei has formed the Huawei Mobile Service (HMS) ecosystem; however, due to lack of widely known Google apps and Google Playstore, it is unlikely that Huawei will attract new smartphone buyers in the international markets.\nThough Apple is not as dependent on China as Oppo, Huawei, or Vivo, it encountered store closures and supply constraints that adversely affected iPhone sales during the first quarter of 2020. \nApple’s iPhone sales decreased by 8.2%, equivalent to 41 million units in the first quarter of 2020. Oppo ‘s smartphone revenue fell by 19.1% in the first quarter of 2020.

This will drive companies to adopt smarter manufacturing processes that are powered by the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain.\nCurrently, many companies are looking at India as a potential destination and want to divest in China. The manufacturing industry looks at the current situation as an opportunity. Also, the manufacturing sector has to be ready to adopt a tremendous amount of automation.\nGovernments around the world asked firms to cut the dependency on China for imports of finished parts or products. Japan has set down a $2.2-billion economic stimulus package to enable its manufacturers to shift their production out of China. The Indian cabinet has released a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for the electronics sector with an allocation of over Rs 40,000 crore.\nChina already is in a leading position in the manufacturing sector in terms of AI investment.

AI can also assist in supply chain optimisation by forecasting demand as well as returns. The data fed to an AI model comes via the network of industrial IOTs deployed on the production floor.  This network is composed of sensors mounted on devices to collect information about their functioning and performance in real-time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also revealed supply chain network vulnerabilities.  Blockchain can assist businesses to recognise the point of disruption by linking all stakeholders in an extended network, allowing them to plan for potential challenges which may arise in the future. A sophisticated RPA bot could gather information across manufacturing ecosystems such as warehousing, inventory, suppliers, logistics, vendor systems and use the cognitive capabilities in the tool to implement actions that improve the overall efficiencies of the complete ecosystem.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic would precipitate the entire push towards Industry 4.0.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The Supreme Court lifted a ban levied by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) concerning cryptocurrency payments on March 4. In April 2018, the RBI circular had banned the use of bank payment systems for cryptocurrency-related payments. Nevertheless, some of the cryptocurrency exchanges continued to run, concentrating on trading between cryptocurrencies instead of Indian investors making fresh investments in cryptocurrency. In a few cases, they carried on with processing rupee payments via peer-to-peer mechanisms.\nCoinDCX, which claims to be India’s largest crypto exchange continued to operate even after the ban. The exchange had observed a sharp increase in both users as well as trading volumes after the SC judgement. The transaction has witnessed about a 10x spike in the area of sign-ups after the SC judgment. The BTC/INR (Bitcoin to Indian Rupees) trading pair has seen a growth of 78.36% in the last 50 days. Also, the CoinDCX exchange has gained around 50,000 users within 50 days.\nTwo factors have been pushing the volumes. Firstly, most transactions on crypto exchanges are trading transactions, and some traders have returned to the market after the SC decision. It’s mostly not new investor money coming in yet. If the latter had occurred the price of saying the bitcoin would have been far higher than it is. That’s because relatively small fiat currency inflows alter cryptocurrency prices in a significant way. Secondly, since people are staying back at home due to the lockdown, they have time to trade on their computers which have contributed to the rise in cryptocurrency trading.\nAlso Read: Supreme Court Declares Cryptocurrency Trading Legal in India\nBitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has risen in the recent uncertainty in the market but has also seen a lot of volatility. Over two days ending March 13, Bitcoin experienced a plunge of around 50%, falling briefly below $4000. Since then, the cryptocurrency had recovered approximately $6800 for trading when this report was released. In terms of the US currency, it has risen by about 30% over the past year.\nIndian crypto industry leaders are divided about whether some of the newly gained interest in virtual currencies is motivated by central banks’ aggressive monetary policies in reaction to the economic downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. \nWith massive money printing not just in India but globally, what it’s doing is slowly decreasing rupee’s purchasing power. In India, there is a tiny percentage of people who note that and hedge their portfolios against crypto.\nSome advocates of cryptography have drawn a comparison between virtual currencies and gold that often serves as a buffer against inflation and rises when monetary policy is loose.\nAlso, investors should take note of the regulatory risks related to virtual currencies. The Supreme Court overturned the RBI ban on cryptocurrency-based payments but did not rule on cryptocurrency legality in India. A proposed government bill allegedly aimed to criminalize mere crypto-currency possession in India in 2019. The bill was not, however, published in Parliament. In addition to regulatory threats, investors should also bear in mind that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile and can cause substantial losses.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

        "data": "India has come up with a contact tracing app for patients infected with the coronavirus. The name of this app is “Aarogya Setu”. With the help of Bluetooth, this app keeps a record of mobile phones which come in contact with each other. In case a user tests positive for COVID-19, this app will send in an alert to every device a patient’s phone comes in contact with.\nWhen an individual test positive for coronavirus, he or she will need to key in that information on the application. The app will be able to warn all those who get in contact with the infected patient because the app has already recorded that information. Instead of depending on a patient’s memory, a contact-tracing application will alert others who may have come in contact with a COVID-19 patient immediately. \nExperts claim that this app can be of help; however, it’s not enough to cut down the chain of transmission on its own. Contact tracking apps such as the Aarogya Setu app depend on Bluetooth signals and GPS location data to monitor devices that have interacted with each other.\nA former Google employee, Lalitesh Katragadda, worked on Aarogya Setu along with a team of 30 volunteers said that the app was built to ensure the government can handle resources in case there is an explosion of COVID-19 cases. He also said that distributing resources would be much harder if the government had to rely on monitoring people by tracing their phones to the cell towers. Though technically it is feasible to do so, in an emergency, there will be no time to do so.\nAlso Read: COVID-19: UV LEDs Capable of Disinfecting Contaminated Surfaces\nAlthough there are questions about how successful the technology really can be, there are still legitimate concerns about privacy. The government now has access not only to our names and date of birth but also to our biometric records. The government will not only know who we are and where we are and who we meet, but it will also be able to use this knowledge in ways that give it more influence and power over people.\nThen, questions are raised about the form of data obtained. The list is broad and extensive, and there seems to be no stringent restriction to the reason for which the information is being collected. This can be used to assign resources to others, and it can also be misused and used to expose the sources of a journalist while revealing raw location data.\nThere are good reasons why society is concerned about contact-tracing apps, and why these apps have raised concerns about surveillance, particularly in countries that do not have proper privacy protection mechanisms in place. India’s data privacy bill is expected to be taken up in this Parliament’s monsoon session. Many will hesitate to use the software if the issues aren’t resolved. In other words, not taking into account privacy issues may backfire.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

UV light is used for the decontamination of surfaces, floors, and personal protective equipment within the HVAC systems.\nChristian Zollner, whose research focuses on advancing deep UV light LED technology for purification and sanitation purposes, added that UV-C disinfection products already have a small market in medical contexts.\nPointing out the various forms of UV light, Zollner said that UV-A and UV-B are light which Earth receives courtesy from the Sun with essential uses, and the unusual UV-C is the light of choice for inactivating microbes and also for purifying air and water.\nZoller also mentioned that the UV-C light in the wavelength range of 260 – 285 Nanometer is most appropriate for the present disinfection technologies; however, it is also harmful to human skin. Hence, for now, it is mainly used in applications where nobody is present at the time of disinfection.\nAlso Read: Evolution of the Fintech Platforms in India\nZoller believes that UV LED will need a lot of technical advances to achieve its potential in terms of performance, reliability, cost, and lifespan.\nDuring the research, the scientists have reported a simple procedure for fabricating high-quality deep UV-C LEDs. This, as per the study, includes depositing a film consisting of the aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN) semiconductor alloy on a base which is made of silicon carbide (SiC) — a departure from the most commonly used sapphire substrate. \nZoller mentioned that the use of silicon carbide as a substrate permits a more cost-effective and efficient growth of high-quality UV-C semiconductor material versus the usage of sapphire. He also added that silicon carbide is much less costly than the “ideal” aluminium nitride substrate, making it more productive-friendly for mass production. \nAs scientists across the world rush to find COVID-19 vaccinations, treatments and cures, Zollner suggests that disinfection, isolation, and decontamination are the only tools to protect people and that the solutions will need to be deployed across the world.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

This has resulted in lessening a common man’s efforts to get access to his or her funds since access to digital platforms has increased. \nFintech has emerged as the most robust lending platform, shifting the conventional banking methods and transforming end-to-end customer travel. This has unlocked numerous opportunities for tapping into the extensive, comprehensive customer database allowing for a strong digital foundation.\nThe arrival of platforms for new-age lending has catered for the broader segment of people who need funds. Digitisation has helped the consumer gain financial freedom by making access to affordable finance easier. Fintech platforms provide easy and straightforward access to individuals by merely sitting at the comfort of their homes or offices to meet financial needs to meet their needs.\nFintech platforms have removed the need for frequent branch visits and the need for waiting in long queues has been eliminated too. Fintech companies are steadily scaling up to a higher-value proposition.\nThe Fintech industry is now at the forefront of the financial services sector, thanks to the proliferation of innovations and quick connectivity of smartphones. Chatbots, also called as the conversational agents are changing the overall consumer experience, and exceptionally changing the back-end operations.\nAlso Read: GSTN Allows Tax Officers To Access Their Office Network Remotely\nChatbots are well-equipped with artificial cognition and also natural human language comprehension; they communicate with humans via audio or textual media to translate and answer questions, most of the time, without any human interference. Chatbots allow organisations to provide their customers with a streamlined, personalised, and hassle-free experience at cost-effective prices along with efficiency. \nPrevention of fraud is a vital element to the operating approach of every bank. A chatbot can be configured to track and recognise warning signs of fraudulent behaviour so that the impacted customer can be automatically alerted in real-time via a messaging app. This will also help in retaining a bank’s brand value among its customers.\nRobotic Process Automation has the ability, in many different ways, to make business processes more effective. Robotic course automation systems are ideally suited for repeated, consistent process interactions with IT applications. Usually, these processes lack the scope to justify automation by IT transformation. Computer robots can execute entire end-to-end processes with little human interaction.\nTo cope with this growing Artificial Intelligence (AI) security threat, companies need to modify their security strategies to accommodate not only AI and creativity but also prioritise data protection. The main goal of hackers in the digital economy is to steal data, as this is where the money is. Organisations should use data-centred protection frameworks underpinned by information assurance to protect data, and continue all the developments around AI while continuing to follow a policy of prevention, detection and response.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

They argued that India must be in par with the other countries and allow the trading of cryptocurrencies. As a result, the bench, headed by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, overruled the RBI’s circular with the reason of disproportionality. \nAlso Read: ClearTax acquires Karvy’s GST Filing Business\nFurther, the 180-page verdict reveals that it is not aligned with the assumption of the industry. RBI’s prohibition measure was not in proportion to the threat. Also, the verdict concluded that the RBI did not submit any empirical data to examine alternate methods. \n\nThe Supreme Court specified that there is no law banning virtual currencies yet and therefore, can stand until such a law is in place. Also, cryptocurrencies were referred to as a by-product of blockchain technology and pronounced that the two must be treated as separate entities.

        "data": "The online tax filing platform ClearTax has acquired the Goods and Services Tax (GST) filing business from Karvy, a financial services firm for an undisclosed amount.\nThe deal came at a time when the stockbroking unit of Karvy is looking to sell assets and raise capital to clear dues to banks and investors. Apart from the tech platform, the all-cash deal will see ClearTax acquiring only the Karvy Data Management Services GST business, including its about 200 business customers and 25 employees. However, the entity’s ownership will remain with the Karvy group of companies.\nClearTax CEO Archit Gupta said “We purchased the software properties, employee assets and consumer assets, but they will remain with the company. It’s almost an arms-length sort of transaction. It made sense this way because we did not need another corporation to take over their business.”\nArchit Gupta added that Karvy’s business was going to be merged into ClearTax’s and that the company was trying to accelerate space consolidation. Gaining access to Karvy’s customer base also comes at a time when ClearTax is looking to take advantage of the mandatory electronic invoicing provision for large companies as of April 1.\nAlso Read: MeitY and Law Ministries Yet To Settle Down on Intermediary Guidelines\nThe acquisition is expected to be completed within the next 60 days. It would not be subject to any regulatory scrutiny as it is a separate entity from the one under the regulatory scanner. The regulator has hauled Karvy Stock Broking, an independent entity within the same group, for alleged manipulation of client shares and failure to uphold investor payouts.\nThe Karvy company is facing a Rs 678-crore shortfall in dues to bank and investor, and it had told India’s Securities and Exchange Board and the National Stock Exchange, the market regulator that the dues would be clear by March 2020.\nClearTax said the acquisition would help grow its base with more 1,500 customers. Also, while Karvy only provided GST filing services to its customers, ClearTax can now tap them with its reconciliation and E-way billing solutions, apart from electronic invoicing. Archit Gupta said that to expand inorganically, ClearTax was actively looking at more acquisitions.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at dvsr.anjaneyulu@cleartax.in\nDVSR Anjaneyulu known as AJ, is a Chartered Accountant by profession.

The meet up is said to be done on priority to resolve the differences and conclude with the norms. Intermediaries in the subject are social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, Facebook, and others.\nAs per the schedule, the MeitY had to present the final guidelines before the Supreme Court on or before 15 January 2020. However, an extension was requested regarding the same until the last week of January and, then, the ministry failed to meet the extended deadline. It is said that the intermediary guidelines’ draft was shared with the law ministry for review a few weeks ago, and they haven’t finalised it yet.\nOn the other hand, the law ministry considers the work of MeitY commendable. However, a part of the ministry thinks that some of the stringent amendments such as the traceability or flagging user and non-user content could be left out. This is because the government is already in the process of concluding with the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill that deals with aspects such as data localisation.\nAlso Read: NIC Builds Instant Messaging App for Government Communication\nFurther, the PDP Bill was placed before Parliament on 11 December 2019. A joint parliamentary committee vets the bill. MeitY believes that the draft guidelines are necessary because fake and adultered content has been growing larger every day. The government has to have a mechanism to deal with such issues at least until the Parliament accepts the bill.\nThe draft guidelines released in December 2018 did not receive favour from social media platforms and tech companies. They stated that prohibiting the publication of content that threatens public health and safety may violate the right to free speech as per Article 19 (1).\nIntermediaries deploying tools for removing access to unlawful content seems contrary to a recent judgement of the Supreme Court on user privacy. Also, intermediaries with more than 50 lakh users must set up a company in India. However, the calculation of this number is not defined.

This does even include bigger vehicles such as electric trucks and electric buses. The charging infrastructure needed for electric two-wheeler and three-wheeler vehicles is quite different from that of four-wheeled vehicles.\nAlthough electric cars need a more systematic approach, in terms of public and private charging facilities, two-wheeler and three-wheeler vehicles have a minimum requirement or need. On the other hand, there is no need for massive infrastructure for electric two-wheelers, since their owners already charge them at home.\nIn the case of three-wheelers, the vehicles are used widely as a fleet for commercial reasons, wherein they have their infrastructure. Hence, it seems less profitable to invest in public and private services for these two types of automobiles. At the same time, battery manufacturers believe that these vehicles need some facilities such as battery swapping stations and charging stations for customers.\nAccording to a recent study, 85% charging of electric vehicles takes place at the home of an owner, where most of them live in single homes. It becomes a daunting job for those living in apartments or gated communities, particularly for customers who have no reserved parking facilities, inaccessible electric meters, distorted electric charging ports and others.\nAlso Read: Now, pay a single premium for multiple cars you own\nMost of the consumers fail to mount a home charger due to problems such as configuring electricity metering to a different home and building requirements, no guidelines for electrical connections, lack of appropriate places for installing chargers and more.\nMany consumers today are first-time owners transitioning to the electric vehicle and are unaware of the consequences. If the initial experience goes bad, customers can regret the choice they made. Therefore, ensuring that its customers have a trouble-free experience, both intercity and intracity, is essential for OEMs and electric vehicle infrastructure firms.\nThe state and central governments have been making every effort to encourage the country’s adoption of electric vehicles through new policies and structures for the electric vehicle market.\nWhile the focus has been increased on innovative ways of promoting the inclusion of electric vehicles at the national level, there have also been several state governments at the policy level.\nThe central government approved about 138 charging stations for the state of Telangana. Also, Bengaluru will soon have 112 charging stations for electric vehicles, while also proposing 12 fast-charging outlets.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at bhavana.pn@cleartax.in\nBhavana is a Senior Content Writer handling the GST vertical.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The concept of Aadhaar, since its inception in 2009, has created a lot of buzz across the country. The talks about storing and usage of biometrics along with other personal details of an individual created a storm of debates. Later came the law to link Aadhaar with PAN, bank account, and other digital wallets. \nAadhaar has become the foremost proof to claim that an individual is an Indian citizen. However, when you share your Aadhaar number for any transaction, it implies that you have given them access to your personal details. There arises a serious concern of misuse of crucial information. Many cases of data breach have been reported, making citizens lose trust in the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) system. The government has taken this into consideration and has brought about another version of Aadhaar—masked Aadhaar.\nWhat is Masked Aadhaar?\nMasked Aadhaar is a unique version of Aadhaar, launched by UIDAI, where your Aadhaar number is partially masked or covered on the Aadhaar card. This move is to make the Aadhaar number safer. Here, the first eight digits of your Aadhaar number will be masked and the final four digits will be visible. You can only get this form of Aadhaar as a digital copy and not as a hard copy. \nThe masked version of Aadhaar contains your name, photograph, demographic information, QR code, and other details similar to the physical Aadhaar card. The only difference is the masking of the Aadhaar number.\nAlso Read: PAN-Aadhaar Linking Gets Extended for the Eighth Time\nHow and When to Use the Masked Aadhaar?\nDownload the masked Aadhaar from the official website of UIDAI at https://uidai.gov.in/. When you click on ‘Download Aadhaar’, you can see a checkbox with the label ‘I want a masked Aadhaar’. Select the option before hitting the download button to get your masked Aadhaar.\nThe masked Aadhaar card can be used in place of the regular Aadhaar card for transactions at almost all private and public establishments in the country. For example, you can provide masked Aadhaar for e-KYC purposes where it is not mandatory to share the soft copy or a photocopy of your Aadhaar card. \nOn the other hand, you may not be able to use the masked Aadhaar card to apply for any government welfare schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, LPG subsidies, and to open bank accounts. In such cases, you have to provide the entire twelve-digit Aadhaar number to avail the benefits of the schemes.\nThe purpose behind the idea of masked Aadhaar is to provide limited visibility to third-party enterprises where Aadhaar is to be used as an identity proof. This way, you let the third-party check your photograph on your masked Aadhaar card and the last four digits of your Aadhaar number. They will not be able to store the entire Aadhaar number or get access to crucial information linked to the number. Isn’t this a more secure way of dealing with your daily life transactions?\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at apoorva.n@cleartax.in"

Ironic that in a country that has a goddess worshipped for watching over and providing people with wealth and fortune, female financial inclusion is still a far-fetched dream. \nAccording to a recent study released by the World Bank, 42% of the female bank accounts in India are dormant. This is by far the highest proportion of dormant accounts in the world. Also, when it comes to savings and borrowings, the report card of female account holders is marked with the proverbial red ink.\nMoreover, it is a truth universally acknowledged that the wage gap between men and women in India is the widest, in case of the hourly pay of labour. According to the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) recent findings, Indian women are paid 34% less than their male counterparts.\nIn a scenario like this, the digital boom that India is witnessing has a vital role to play in shrinking the gender gap in financial inclusion. Especially FinTech that specialises in banking and other financial services need to step up and make finance more accessible to women in India.\nAlso Read: What does FM have for women and education in Union Budget 2019?\nSpreading financial awareness could be a good approach to begin the revolution.

They will also need to simplify their programmes in order to make it more comprehensive. \nFinTechs can also utilise various financial literacy initiatives undertaken by the Reserve Bank of India, the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the Insurance Regulatory, and Development Authority along with the government. \nNext is to provide financial assistance to micro-entrepreneurship which will strengthen women’s role in the economy making them more financially independent.

        "data": "India currently ranks second after the United States when it comes to the country with the most number of FinTech companies. One might wonder how our country was able to rise to that level. Well, the answer is pretty simple.\nDo you remember the demonetization wave that hit our nation in Q4 2016? Over the last three years, the FinTech industry has witnessed a significant rise in its consumer base not only in metro cities but also in the Tier II and Tier II cities as well.\nWith the smartphone userbase improving in the rural areas, FinTech startups are coming up with innovative and user-friendly online platforms to make banking easier. Imagine travelling kilometres to visit the bank or an institution to make a payment.\nIt is a tiring process which also requires you to spend your hard-earned money. Why go through the trouble of visiting a bank when you can make a payment with a few clicks on your phone? This is precisely where fintech startups have set their focus on now – making rural life easier.\nWhen the Unique Payments Interface (UPI)-based payment was introduced, people in Tier II and Tier III cities were concerned about making payments through an online platform. However, the concerns have subsided now with individuals and merchants being able to make secure transactions only with a few clicks on their phone.\nWe, as human beings, always look for things that can make our lives easier. If we find an online platform can facilitate our banking process, we would most likely go for it. This human behaviour is what drives the fintech companies.\nThe payment segment has always been one of the major focal points for the FinTech sector. The evolving mindset and ever-increasing userbase in rural India have led to FinTech companies coming up with online platforms every other day.\nCompanies also offer other financial services such as instant loans, insurance, and online shopping to help consumers enjoy the benefits of financial inclusion in rural areas.\nAlso Read: How Regulatory Sandbox Works in India for FinTech\nFinTech plays a significant role in breaking the so-called status barrier between rural and urban areas by offering the best services, improving the way of life in rural areas. Furthermore, these digital platforms also come in different languages to discard the language barrier.\nFinancial inclusion of small-scale businesses in rural areas will allow innovative entrepreneurs to expand their business. Most of the small-scale business in the country takes place in rural India. FinTech companies play a huge role in this sector. Small loans offered to micro-enterprises can help the industry improve considerably while contributing to the country’s GDP.\nHowever, the primary concern for fintech companies in India is the lack of awareness of financial inclusion in rural areas. Most Tier II and Tier III have little knowledge of the digital world. Companies are conducting campaigns around the country to educate the rural Indian about financial inclusion and how it can make his life more comfortable. \nAccording to a recent report by NASSCOM-KPMG, the FinTech software and services market in India is expected to grow by 1.7 times by 2020 over the $8m billion the country had achieved in 2016. Furthermore, the Indian FinTech software market is also expected to hit $2.4 billion by 2020. With the e-commerce wave spreading across the country, I feel that FinTech companies will serve as an economic powerhouse for the country and digitise rural India in the coming years.\nAbbreviation is the name of the game – SIP, NPS, ELSS, KTM, and OMR.\nVishnu is the cat that got too curious.

FinTech is another sector that has seen fast growth in recent times.\nThe scope of its growth is high in India as there is much to be done for better market penetration. With more and more FinTech products lining up to reach consumers, there is a need to build a framework to protect consumers’ privacy as well as organise market development through a regulatory sandbox approach.\nWhat is Regulatory Sandbox?\nA regulatory sandbox is a process of testing new products and services in a controlled/regulated environment within a specified protected data set. It insists on testing multiple innovations and failures can be analysed without an actual system risk. \nRegulators, innovators, financial service providers, and end-users take part in field tests and collectively decide on the benefits and risks of the innovations. Consequently, low-cost financial products can be framed.\nRBI Introduces New Regulatory Sandbox Initiative\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has set up an inter-regulatory Working Group (WG) to understand and prepare a report on the finer details of FinTech. The core agenda of setting this committee is to analyse the regulatory framework of the industry. The WG released the report on 8 February 2018 in order to receive public feedback. One of the significant recommendations made by WG is to provide a structure for regulatory sandbox (RS) that results in increased efficiency and manage risk.\nBenefits of Sandbox\nHere is a list of benefits that regulatory sandbox can bring-in:\nAlso Read: SEBI floats discussion paper on fintech Regulatory Sandbox\nQuick Look at Other Countries’ Sandbox Initiatives\nThe regulations adopted in the FinTech industry across the countries of the world vary. Consider the case of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). With the launch of ‘Project Innovate’ in 2014, the FCA has received recognition for its sandbox that includes innovative models tested under a live market environment. About 500 companies have received the support of sandbox so far.\nThe UK’s FinTech membership body, Innovate Finance launched its own regulatory sandbox in 2015. The Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) and De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) have been running a regulatory sandbox in the Netherlands since 2016. \nIn addition, FCS has announced the creation of Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN) where it has partnered with 11 foreign regulators and related firms from across the world.\nThis network is to realise the ‘global sandbox’ which reduces the time to bring ideas to international markets. Two of these regulators are the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).\nThe concept of the regulatory sandbox has been displaying the potential to solve problems at the source of credit solutions.

However, at present, this scheme does not cater to the exporters and only focuses on the domestic market.\nThe recent investment of Euro 5.5 million and partnership with the global leader of container shipping A.P. Moller-Maersk have fuelled the expansion of MODIFI to India.  The CEO of MODIFI expects that the partnership will give credibility to this company amongst the exporters in India.\nBy 2020, the organisation expects to invest a finance volume of $1 billion in this country. Presently, MODIFI is focussing on creating awareness about the platform and onboarding multiple SMEs.\nAn Editor by day and a sloth by night…I would love to eat and sleep throughout the day if given a chance…I enjoy reading and love my job and my team at ClearTax."

With this interaction, there is more scope for taxpayers to evade taxes.\nWith the implementation of the “faceless assessment” system via the electric mode, the need for a human interface between the taxpayer and the department will be cut down. Also, the government plans to make pre-filled tax returns available to taxpayers wherein information related to bank interest, salaries, dividend income, and capital gain will be pre-populated.\nAlso Read: Union Budget 2019: TDS of 2% on Cash Withdrawals from Bank Accounts\nFM mentioned that initially, the new process of examination would be limited to inspection of specific discrepancies and transactions.

The Assessing officer’s name/designation/location will not be disclosed.\nThe Modi government aims to curb tax evasion by introducing faceless IT assessment and making pre-populated ITR available for taxpayers.

        "data": "The word ‘fintech’ is an amalgam of the words finance and technology. The term ‘fintech’ was first used in the year 2011. Fintech companies exist with the intent to simplify various financial procedures. These companies have developed sophisticated technologies to compete against conventional ways of monetary transactions and offer multiple services like payments, lending, and quick investment.\nLeveraging the services of a fintech company is remarkably simple. You just need to have a mobile phone or laptop/desktop with an internet connection. Millennials are tech-savvy- they want things happening at their fingertips, in a matter of a few seconds. This has forced banks and financial companies to update their age-old practices with the latest technology. Hence, banks have launched digital interfaces through which you get various banking services.\nInitially, the public sector banks were reluctant to upgrade their traditional banking process. On the other hand, the private sector banks learnt what the modern world needed and came up with revolutionary changes in their banking practises, and thus attracted a large customer base. Online banking was first introduced in India in the year 1996. \nIt’s a known fact that public sector banks are poignant when it comes to following rules. The private sector banks are quite relaxed on rules as they have implemented the latest technology. Realising this, most public sector banks have now implemented the latest banking technologies to stay on par with the private sector banks. Such is the impact of fintech on the banking sector. \nApart from the banking sector, technology has revolutionised the following industries:\nThe modern insurers have understood the needs of the millennials and have adopted the necessary changes to suit their needs. Most insurers now offer an online procedure for submitting the application, filing claims and customer support. They have made the whole process seamless. Some insurers allow beneficiaries to initiate claims with a call and WhatsApp message. The documentation is very minimal and can be submitted online, effectively removing the need for a customer to visit the insurer’s office.\nGone are the days when people stood in the long bank and ATM queues to withdraw cash. Most hotels and shops now accept digital payments. Various mobile wallets offer payments services. Most banks now have their own payments mobile application. Payments apps provide services like a person to person cash transfer, prepaid mobile recharge, utility bill payments, and so on. The digitisation of money has enabled a cashless economy. \nThe advent of fintech has digitised lending. Making multiple trips to the lender’s office is a thing of yesteryears. Fintech has enabled an online procedure for loan application. Fintech has not only taken the lending business online but has also made the process simpler and much faster. Some lenders offer instant loans with minimum documentation. All you need to have is PAN and identity proof.\nThe investment firms are significantly benefitted with the coming of fintech companies. Previously, investors had to furnish various documents before they invested. Fintech companies have completely transformed the KYC documentation process. The KYC documentation has been made simple and hassle-free with the establishment of the Central KYC Registry (CKYC). Fintech companies have extirpated numerous investment formalities. You can effortlessly invest online in FDs, mutual funds and stock markets.\nConclusion\nFintech has taken the financial industry to the next level and has made financial procedures customer friendly. Fintech helps both consumers and businesses to run seamlessly. It saves time and efforts by offering innovative ideas for financial players to stay competitive in this highly contentious sector. Fintech companies have revolutionised the procedure of KYC documentation, making the lives of investors easy.  The arrival of fintech companies has facilitated financial inclusion. The launch of UPI and BHIM has attracted millions of Indians to transact online.  \nEngineer by qualification, financial writer by choice. I am always open to learning new things."

However, the resolution is around the corner; the Supreme court has set the final hearing for the 23rd of July this year. The court has asked the RBI to formulate regulation and settle this issue for good.\nSince the ban on cryptocurrency by the RBI took effect, the Indian crypto circuit has been in a fugue state. Many experts point towards the ambiguity and newness of the virtual currency as the reason behind the indecision of the money handlers of the country. Some point fingers to the complacency and the rigid mindset of the same money handlers as the setback.\nBoth arguments hold water to some extent.\nCryptocurrency is decentralised and anonymous, hence tracking and keeping a check on transactions is near impossible. The anonymity of the system even makes it difficult to trace theft or fraudulent behaviour. Above that, the fear of destabilising the Indian Rupee is also a significant cause of uncertainty, although adoption of cryptocurrency has not destabilised the currency of any country so far.\nOn the other hand, adoption of this new technology should statistically be smooth, given that India 83% of the population have readily adopted new technology, as per a poll conducted by Statista. Indians have been readily accepting new financing solution technology and is second only to China when it comes to adopting new technology.\nThe lethargy to act promptly and create adequate legislation has put the industry on the back foot. The existing rigidity in the legislature coupled with the ambiguity of the new technology has left make budding entrepreneurs and crypto-enthusiasts in the dark while other countries have embarked on their path of exploration.\nIndia might have a late start, but we will start nonetheless.

Even the trading process is regulated differently by the financial authorities of the various countries. In India, there is very little clarity about how to deal with crypto. India is still undecided on whether crypto assets should be treated as an asset class.\nA cryptocurrency can is a digital asset created to serve as a medium of exchange and uses cryptography to secure financial transactions.\nInstead of using a centralised digital currency and central banking system cryptocurrencies maintain a decentralised control. The decentralised control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.\nBitcoin is considered as the first decentralised cryptocurrency; it initially released as open-source software in 2009. Since Bitcoins release, over 4,000 alternative variants of bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies have been introduced.\nThere is no clear rule of law in the Indian legislation that defines taxation of crypto assets; this has led to chartered accountants to interpret the taxation rules that already exist in terms of crypto assets.\nIncome earned by trading cryptocurrency is not considered as a normal income. It is, instead, treated as a capital gain. Typically, capital gains apply to profits earned from the sales of a moveable or immovable asset.\nEssentially accountants are treating cryptocurrency as an asset much gold or real estate that can be sold for a profit rather than as a currency. So for all purposes, capital gains tax is applied on crypto related income earned by an Indian in the country.\nOne must keep in mind that capital gains tax rates are subject to the holding period of the asset, which implies that the period the person holds the cryptocurrency will determine the rate of taxation applicable. If the individual has an annual income of more than 10 lakh, then they will be charged a tax of 30% for short term crypto earnings and 20% for long term crypto earnings.\nIn case of someone who has mined their cryptocurrency, it might not be treated as a capital asset. Hence, they will not be charged a capital gains tax. The income earned from the sale of that cryptocurrency will be considered as ‘income from other sources’ and taxed accordingly.\nAlthough, the RBI will be presenting crypto regulations as per the Supreme Courts request. Once these new regulations are notified, then the taxation of cryptocurrencies might become more explicit. Let’s wait and see what happens."

A cost-effective and feasible alternative is the need of the hour for the fin-tech firms.\nThe Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is the regulatory body that handles Aadhaar as well as the offline citizen records. UIDAI recommends that a company seeking to access Aadhaar data must download either the XML format or the new QR codes from the UIDAI portal; this ensures absolute data and privacy protection.\nThe fin-tech sector is not keen on this proposed method as it has multiple steps including getting an OTP via SMS and enabling numerous permissions, downloading the XML file and then using it as an ID. It is highly unlikely that customers will opt for this when they can upload any other ID card instead of Aadhaar.\nLimited internet bandwidth, especially in remote areas, is another concern raised by the industry experts as the process will make for bad user experience. Also, mobile numbers in use and the one registered for Aadhaar do not match as people change their numbers frequently.\nIt will be a herculean task to onboard people from remote regions without Aadhaar authentication as it negates the need for extensive documentation.

        "data": "The US division of eToro, the leading social trading platform, conducted a survey, entailing numerous queries related to cryptocurrency and blockchain on 18 December. It concluded that the lack of knowledge and access to reliable data and educational materials was preventing investors from trading in digital assets.\n69% of the survey participants including crypto investors said that they would like to learn more about this digital currency. Among those who have never ventured the crypto way, at least 75% said they were unaware about it. It was worrying that 20% of crypto holders also echoed the same.\n50% of the respondents made it clear that the only thing that is stopping them from investing is their lack of knowledge and they do not know where to access the information they need. Furthermore, 97% of Gen-X, as well as Millennial participants (including crypto investors), mentioned that they need to educate themselves about this asset class.\n74% of women said that they need more educational materials on cryptocurrency compared to 54% male participants. Consequently, the dilettantes’ inference of the results was awareness is the key to improve their investor base.\nAnother expert opined that just because ignorance prevents people from delving into crypto doesn’t automatically mean that knowledge will make them invest. They can also research on the topic and then decide it is not worth their time.\nFor retail distributors and agents, not knowing the subject can work both ways. For instance, unscrupulous companies often exploit people’s inexperience and use it to their advantage to grease their palms.\nProgressive firms should study and figure out gaps in the materials and references available at present. Make use of investor forums and social media platforms to understand the pulse of investors. It is essential to keep an eye on the materials populated on these online portals to prevent scamming and improve the image of the cryptocurrency industry.\n "

        "data": "1. Hi. I am a dealer supplying goods with a registered office in Bangalore. ABC Ltd., based in Karnataka, recently made a purchase for Rs.1 lakh and instructed me to ship it to a warehouse in Tamil Nadu. Will I need to raise an invoice charging CGST/SGST or charging IGST?\nAnswer: This will be a ‘bill to ship to’ transaction case. ‘Bill to ship to’ transactions involve three parties – the supplier, the recipient and the third person. The goods are shipped to the recipient by the supplier on the instructions of a third person. The first part of the transaction will be between the supplier and the third person. The next will be between the third person and the recipient. GST is charged to both recipients depending on their places of business. \nIn this situation, you are the supplier, the warehouse in Tamil Nadu is the recipient, and ABC Ltd. is the third person. The first invoice raised by you to ABC Ltd. will need to have state tax (SGST) and central tax (CGST) charged as it is an intra-state supply. The second invoice raised by ABC Ltd. to the company based in Tamil Nadu will have integrated GST (IGST) charged as it is an interstate transaction.\n2. Hello. I purchased a house property under construction a couple of years ago, but the project was never completed. The builder has agreed to refund the amount paid to me, excluding the GST portion, as the same has already been paid to the government. Is there a way for me to claim this GST paid? \nAnswer: The CBIC recently released a circular detailing the process where a GST refund can be claimed by unregistered persons under two scenarios. One of them includes cases where a construction contract has been cancelled for reasons such as non-completion or delay. In such cases, the buyer may receive a refund from the builder without GST as the same would have already been paid to the government, and the time limit for issuing a credit note would have also expired.\nIn this case, you can file a refund application on the common GST portal by obtaining a temporary GST registration. You will need to select the same state/Union Territory as the supplier in respect of whose invoices you are filing the refund application. After you log in, go to Services -> Refunds -> Application for Refund. Under refund type, select ‘Refund for Unregistered Taxpayer’. Proceed to fill in the necessary details and upload the relevant documents.\nPlease note that you will also need to complete the mandatory Aadhaar authentication and provide the bank account details that are in your name and obtained using your PAN.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "1. The government recently notified e-invoicing for businesses with more than Rs.20 crore turnover. What are the options available for generating e-invoices?\nAns: If your business is now eligible for e-invoices, you may be confused about the many options available for e-invoice generation and would obviously be looking for a solution that is fast, seamless, and cost-effective. The government does provide a free Excel-based tool. However, generating e-invoices using this tool is very time-consuming as no bulk e-invoice generation option is available. The e-invoices need to be generated one by one. Also, since the entire process is manual, it could be prone to human errors.\nThe popular option for businesses with an Rs.20+ crore turnover eligible for e-invoicing is to use an advanced web-based tool for e-invoice generation. Leading compliance providers offer these UI tools in the market and can be set up in just 10-15 minutes.  Businesses are provided with an Excel template that is easy-to-use and very user-friendly. The tool can ingest and upload data for the bulk generation of e-invoices with a single click. \nAre there faster, automated options available for small businesses too? Yes, small businesses can generate e-invoices through an ERP integration mode as well. The two popular integration options are API and SFTP integrations. Here, the ERP/accounting system is integrated with the e-invoice portal for the automated generation and cancellation of e-invoices in real-time. \n2. What are the top features to keep in mind while selecting an e-invoicing solution?\nAns: While selecting an e-invoicing solution, it is needless to say that you need to look for one that is fast, has a bulk generation feature, and can assure you of error-free e-invoices. Remember that if your e-invoices have errors, you could be liable to hefty penalties. But, of course, that is not all. \nThe other major features that you need to ensure that your e-invoicing solution has are smart data validations right from the ingestion stage to the e-invoice generation stage. The government utility has very minimal validations, but leading compliance solutions offer 200+ smart data validations for virtually error-free e-invoices. Then, advanced solutions also offer SmartScreen corrections to correct errors on screen and reduce errors. MIS reports and a smart dashboard are also useful features that assist managerial decision-making. Besides the above, look for a solution with a 7-8 years data archival option, a quick response time of fewer than 200 milliseconds (non-NIC), and a unified tool for generating e-way bills.\n3. What are the penalties that eligible businesses will face for not complying with e-invoicing norms from 1st April 2022?\nAns: Eligible businesses who do not meet the e-invoicing implementation deadline could be liable to heavy penalties and could also deal with an unfavourable business impact, such as-\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "data": "1. If I have voluntarily registered under GST previously, do I need to amend my GST registration if I have begun to sell goods on an e-commerce portal?\nAns: If you are registering under GST as a new business to sell on an e-commerce portal, then under ‘Reason to obtain registration’, you need to select ‘Selling through e-commerce portal’. However, suppose you have already registered under GST voluntarily. In that case, you are not required to amend your registration to sell on an e-commerce portal, except if you need to add a place of business or make a core/non-core amendment to your GST registration. \n2. Are e-commerce sellers entitled to the threshold exemption under GST? \nAns: No. According to Section 24(ix) of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, the threshold exemption under GST is not available in cases where the seller sells via an e-commerce operator liable to collect tax at source (TCS) under Section 52. However, service providers are eligible for the threshold exemption if their turnover does not exceed Rs.20 lakh in a financial year. \nAn exemption is also available to suppliers who provide services specified in the notification issued under Section 9(5), such as:\n3. Are all e-commerce operators required to collect tax on behalf of their suppliers? Also, is an e-commerce operator liable to pay taxes instead of the supplier regarding the supply of goods/services made through it?\nAns: Yes, every e-commerce operator (other than the operators paying tax under Section 9(5) of the CGST Act) is required to collect tax where the e-commerce operator collects the consideration regarding the taxable supply. \nIn the case of services notified under Section 9(5) of the CGST Act, the e-commerce operator pays the tax. All the Act’s provisions will apply to the e-commerce operator as if they were the supplier liable to pay tax regarding the supply of such services.\n4. If I am a supplier who sells my products via a website hosted by me, do I fall under the definition of an e-commerce operator, and am I required to collect TCS on such supplies? \nAns: As per Sections 2 (44) and 2(45) of the CGST Act, you will fall under the definition of an e-commerce operator. However, as per Section 52 of the Act, TCS must be collected only on the net value of taxable supplies sold through it by other suppliers. The e-commerce operator collects the consideration. Hence, if a supplier sells their products through their website, there’s no requirement to collect TCS.\n5. Can sellers supplying goods via an e-commerce operator(s) have a commonplace of business?\nAns: Yes, sellers supplying goods via e-commerce operators can have a commonplace of business. Any registered person can declare any premises as their place of business if they have the requisite documents to use the premises, and there is no restriction on using the premises by multiple persons. \n6. If a seller sells goods via two or more e-commerce operators, who must deduct TCS? \nAns: If a seller sells goods via two or more e-commerce operators, then in such cases, each transaction will need to be treated separately and examined according to the provisions of Section 52 of the CGST Act. TCS will be deducted accordingly.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": " \n1. How can we avoid losing input tax credit when our suppliers do not file their returns on time?\nAns: Until now, most businesses did not frequently reconcile their purchase books with the GSTR-2A/2B. It used to be carried out at the end of the month/quarter, or even annually. Further, there was always the option to claim a provisional input tax credit (ITC) in the event certain suppliers had not uploaded invoices. \nHowever, due to the amended Section 16(2)(aa), there is now added pressure on businesses to accurately report ITC each month. Excess ITC could lead to demand notices and penalties, while suboptimal (i.e. less) ITC could hit a business’s cash flows badly as the GST cash liability increases. \nThe solution here is for enterprises to undertake frequent, dynamic, real-time reconciliations of purchase data. Doing this manually is time-consuming, complex, and can be prone to errors. This brings in the need for tech intervention. Businesses should look at automating their reconciliations so that the same can be carried out at regular intervals, with a click of a button. In the event that any missing or incorrect invoices are found, there should be an automated system where an email/message gets sent to the vendor. Likewise, follow-up or reminders should be automatically sent out until the vendors upload the invoices.\nThis is the only way that businesses can ensure 100% accurate input tax credit claims in light of the new amendment.\n \n2. The new Section 16(2)(aa) amendment puts an increased dependency on vendors to upload invoices on time. Despite this, there are several non-compliant vendors who default in uploading invoices. Why should my business suffer just because my vendors do not upload invoices on time? \n \nAns: The dependency on vendors is unprecedented after the notification of Section 16(2)(aa). But, no business deserves to lose out on precious input tax credit just because their vendors are non-compliant. But, how many businesses actually penalise their vendors for non-compliance? \nWith the new amendments in place, enterprises must look at disciplining their defaulting vendors by holding payments at an invoice level or at least the GST amount. However, all of this cannot be carried out manually as it becomes impossible to track the status of each invoice when there are thousands involved. Further, the holding of vendor payments should be done within the scope of the law. This highlights the need for an advanced tech-based solution to streamline vendor communication and payments. \nLet’s take a look at how you can automate your business’s ITC claims, along with vendor communication and payments, through an advanced, tech-based compliance solution. \nUsing an advanced compliance platform like this can help reduce defaulting vendors over time and optimise input tax credit claims. This further unlocks working capital and enhances profitability. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

How does the newly amended Section 16(2) of the CGST Act affect my business’s ITC claims?\nThe Finance Act 2021 had introduced a new clause (aa) under Section 16(2) of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act. However, this clause came into force only from 1st January 2022. According to the newly amended section, taxpayers can claim an input tax credit (ITC) only if their vendors upload an invoice or debit note in their corresponding GSTR-1 return or Invoice Furnishing Facility (IFF).

How is Section 16(2) different from Rule 36(4) of the CGST Rules?\nRule 36(4) has been in place since 2019, and it governed provisional ITC, which was capped at 20% then. This gave taxpayers enough leeway to claim the ITC on invoices their vendors had not yet uploaded or defaulted in uploading. This limit later got capped at 10% and then 5%. From 1st January 2022, Rule 36(4) was further amended to obliterate the concept of provisional ITC.

The NOC will have to be submitted along with the other relevant documents that are prescribed for GST registration.\n2.

Why am I liable to pay 12% GST?\nIn March 2019, the GST Council reduced GST rates on residential projects in affordable and non-affordable segments. For affordable housing projects, the rate was reduced from 8% to 1%, without input tax credit. For non-affordable projects, the rate was reduced from 12% to 5%, without input tax credit.\nFor projects that have commenced on or after 1st April 2019, the builders need to mandatorily pay tax at the new rate of 5% for non-affordable projects and 1% for affordable projects. However, for those projects that were ongoing, i.e. had begun construction prior to 1st April 2019, the real estate developer/builder was given the option of choosing between the old rates and new rates of GST.  \nHence, if your builder had opted for the old rate of GST, i.e. 12% in this case, then you will have to pay GST as per the old rate. \n2. I am purchasing a row house in Bangalore in the non-affordable housing segment. The builder is providing other services along with construction such as clubhouse membership, advance maintenance fees, development charges, etc. What is the rate of GST applicable on these other charges that are charged by the builder?\nIn a ruling by the Maharashtra Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR), it was ruled that the other charges charged by the builder do not fall under the scope of a composite supply. In fact, most builders show these charges separately, and the buyer pays stamp duty excluding these charges. Hence, these services are not naturally bundled. \nGoing by this ruling, 18% GST will be applicable on other charges like clubhouse charges, electricity meter installation, maintenance fees, legal fees, development charges, etc., that are charged by a builder.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

For example, CGST to SGST.\nAnswer: The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has provided for the shifting of tax paid under the wrong tax head using Form PMT-09. Using this form, a registered taxpayer can transfer any amounts of tax, interest, penalty, etc., available in the electronic cash ledger, into the appropriate tax or cess head under IGST, CGST, and SGST in the electronic cash ledger. \nHence, if you have incorrectly paid CGST instead of SGST, you can now rectify the same using Form PMT-09 by reallocating the amount from the CGST head to the SGST head. It is important to note that the tax amount wrongly paid into the electronic cash ledger should not have been utilised for any payment. \n2. The turnover in my Form 26AS is not matching with the turnover in my GSTR-3B. What are my next steps?\nAnswer: The turnover reported in Form 26AS and the GSTR-3B return may not match because of differences arising from branch transfers, exempt turnover, etc. You will need to undertake a proper month-wise reconciliation to find out why these differences exist. \nIf there are genuine errors, you need to disclose the same when filing the annual GSTR-9. If GSTR-9 does not apply to your business, undertake the reconciliation process and maintain a record of all the mismatches. This way, in case you receive a notice from the CBIC, you can comply by providing the requisite data. \nAlso, note that if there is a shortfall of tax, the same needs to be paid while filing GSTR-3B of the next return period or filing Form DRC-03. Alternately, if the taxes paid are in excess, the same can be claimed as a refund. \n3. I had cancelled my GST registration in March 2019 as I used only to sell exempted items then. How can I revoke my cancelled registration under the GST Amnesty Scheme?\nAnswer: The revocation of cancellation of GST registration under the GST Amnesty Scheme is only meant for cases where the registration has been cancelled due to non-filing of GST returns or violation of the provisions of the GST law. If you cancel your registration due to any other reason, you will not revoke the same under the GST Amnesty Scheme.\n4.

However, the cancellation should be made within 24 hours from the time of generation. \nIf 10 days have passed, like in this situation, it could result in a notice from the department as there would be a difference between the e-way bill records and the GST returns filed.

        "data": "I had invested Rs 3,00,000 in XYZ Equity Mutual Fund (dividend option) on February 20, 2018, for 10,000 units at Rs 30 per unit.\nOn April 1, 2019, this fund was merged with the company’s balanced advantage fund and my holding reduced to 8000 units for Rs 2,00,000 at Rs 25 per unit. \nOn April 3, 2020, I switched to a growth option and was allotted 4,000 units at Rs 45 per unit. \nNow on May 4, 2021, the NAV of the fund jumped to Rs 90, and my investment value went up to Rs 3,60,000. If I sell now, how will long-term capital gain be calculated?\nReply:\nThe Income Tax Act states that any transfer resulting from the merger of two or more equity/debt-oriented funds shall not be considered taxable transfers by the unitholder. \nHowever, switching investments from one option to another under the same scheme will be considered redemption (sale). This switch will attract the exit load (if applicable) and capital gain tax. \nHence, in the above scenario, there will be two incidences of taxation :\nThere will be no tax implication in the merger of the mutual fund on April 1, 2019. \nThe tax implication arises when switching the fund from one option to another. This is because the two options within the same scheme have different net asset values (NAVs) and operate differently. \nAs per the above example, the switch was made on April 3, 2020, and so you will have to calculate capital gain on the redemption and report the same in the income tax return for FY 2020-21.\nLikewise, the final sale of mutual fund units was made in May 2021; it will attract long-term capital gain for the FY 2021-22 (the return for which is to be filed next year).\nNow, let us see how the period of holding for classification between long term and short-term gain will be calculated in all these instances:\nNow, for computation of capital gains, the nature of investment schemes shall have to be ascertained firstly. \nIn equity-oriented mutual funds, capital gains will be the ‘long term’ if the holding period is more than one year. The same is computed by subtracting the acquisition cost (without indexation, after considering grandfathering provisions) from the sale consideration. The capital gains above Rs 1 lakh is taxable at 10%.\nIf the mutual funds are debt-oriented, they are considered long-term if held for more than three years; else, the same shall be regarded as short term. The short-term capital gains from debt funds shall be taxable at applicable slabs of the individual investor; long-term gains shall be taxable at 20% after indexation.\nFor FY 2020-21-Switching to growth option from dividend option\nCost of acquisition (without indexation)\nRs. 3,00,000*\n*Grandfathering rule will not be applicable as COA is after 31st January 2018. \nFor FY 2021-22, the final sale of mutual fund units on May 4, 2021.\nCost of acquisition (without indexation\nRs. 1,80,000\nAssuming this is the only LTCG, then as it is less than Rs.1 lakh, the entire tax on LTCG will be exempt. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please get in touch with the writer at jyoti.arora@cleartax.in\nI am a Chartered Accountant by profession with  4+ years of experience in the finance domain.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "1. Is it required to generate a dynamic QR code for invoices issued to a person who has obtained a Unique Identity Number under Section 25(9) of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act 2017?\nAnswer: First, let’s understand the provisions of Section 25(9) of the CGST Act. According to Section 25(9), \nwill be granted a Unique Identity Number (UIN) for such purposes prescribed under the CGST Act. A person who has obtained this UIN is not a ‘registered person’ under the CGST Act 2017. \nTherefore, any invoice issued to a person having a UIN is considered a B2C supply, and hence the supplier is required to comply with dynamic B2C QR code requirements.\n2. If the UPI ID of the payee/person collecting money is linked to their bank account, then should the bank account and IFSC details be provided separately in the dynamic QR code along with the UPI ID?\nAnswer: If the UPI ID of the payee/person collecting money is linked to a specific bank account, then bank account and IFSC details need not be provided separately in the dynamic QR code. \n3. In certain cases, the payments may be collected by a person other than the supplier but authorised by the supplier. For example, e-commerce operators.  Can the authorised person’s UPI ID be provided in place of the supplier’s UPI ID in such cases? \nAnswer: Yes. If the payment is being collected by another person who the supplier has authorised, then the UPI ID of such person may be provided in the dynamic QR code instead of the UPI ID of the supplier. \n4. In some cases, the merchant/supplier has already received part payment before the dynamic QR code is generated. This is either by way of advance or by adjustment, such as vouchers, discount coupons, etc. What is the amount that needs to be provided in the dynamic QR code against ‘invoice value’ in these cases?\nAnswer: The purpose of a dynamic QR code is to enable the customer to scan and pay the amount to the merchant/supplier for the said supply. If part payment has already been received from a customer, the QR code may only provide the remaining amount payable against ‘invoice value’. The details of the total invoice value and the details/cross-reference of the part payment and the remaining amount payable should be provided on the invoice. \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

I had to file some replies towards observations pointed out by the officer via the GST portal by 7th May 2021. However, I missed the deadline. Do I have some relaxation due to the ongoing COVID situation?\nYes. All taxpayers and tax officers, required to take some action within deadlines as per the CGST Rule 9, have got an extension due to the prevailing COVID pandemic. The recently issued Central Tax Notification number 14/2021 dated 1st May 2021 has provided this relaxation. It says that if any action under Rule 9 of the CGST Rules has to be taken within a prescribed deadline between 1st May 2021 to 31st May 2021, then a further time limit has been provided by the notification. Such actions can be taken on or before 15th June 2021.\nTherefore, even if you had to reply before 7th May 2021 as per the rules, you have gotten additional time up to 15th June 2021 to finish this task.\nIs there any extension to the GSTR-6 return for the April 2021 return period?

There are exceptions listed down for the same such as GSTR-1, GSTR-3B (due to separate notifications passed for interest and late fee waiver), e-way bills, invoicing, penalties and prosecution. GSTR-6 is not mentioned in the exceptions, which means that the return filing deadline for April 2021 is extended up to 31st May 2021.\nLikewise, the deadline for GSTR-7 and GSTR-8 for April 2021 is extended from 10th May 2021 up to 31st May 2021.

        "data": "1. I made a mistake in the e-Invoice. How to rectify the mistake?\nNote that the e-invoice portal or Invoice Registration Portal (IRP) does not allow you to rectify or correct the errors in the e-invoice. Hence, you can only cancel that e-invoice. \nFor invoices that have already been uploaded/reported to the IRP and for which an Invoice Reference Number (IRN) has been created, cancellation of the IRN is possible. It must be completed within 24 hours of the data being produced. Some of the most common reasons for the supplier’s cancellation of IRN include:\nCancellation of an IRN is only possible within twenty-four hours of its generation. After the 24-hour period has passed, the supplier must either issue a debit/credit notice or update Form GSTR-1 to change the invoice information.\nIf an e-way bill has been generated or is active for an IRN, it cannot be cancelled. The same invoice number cannot create another IRN until the e-invoice (IRN) has been cancelled. It is not possible to cancel only part of an e-invoice (i.e., IRN).\nYou can either choose one of the modes to cancel an e-invoice, i.e., visiting the e-invoice portal or ERP/accounting software using API interface through ASP-GSP or GSP integration with IRP.\nAfter that, raise a new invoice with the exact particulars but a unique invoice number. It must be reported on the e-invoice portal for IRN generation, and proceed with the e-invoice accordingly.\n2. Can I generate an e-way bill also from the e-invoice portal? What are the prescribed rules?\nThe e-invoice schema or format contains both part-A and part-B of an e-way bill. The information given by the user while generating the IRN for the e-invoice will also be used to create the e-way bill.\nSuppose part-B information is not given when reporting an invoice to IRP. In that case, the user must provide them through the ‘e-way bill’ tab in IRP log in or the e-way bill portal to produce an e-way bill.\nThere is no time limit for generating the e-way bill once an e-invoice is generated from the e-invoice portal or IRP. However, the IRN’s cancellation is not allowed if the linked e-way bill is active or checked by an officer during transit. Further, no new APIs are required to be published for e-way bills if the taxpayer uses one before e-invoicing came into effect.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nAnnapoorna, popularly known as Anna, is an aspiring Chartered Accountant with a flair for GST.

        "data": "1. e-Invoicing has been enabled for my business from 1st April 2021 as my turnover is between Rs.50 and Rs.100 crore. What is sandbox testing, and how do I carry out sandbox testing for my business? Is integrating my ERP the only option for my business?\nSandbox testing is a process mandated by the e-invoice portal to test the APIs (Application Programming Interface) in a step-by-step procedure to understand APIs’ flow. This process will help prepare the payload request with encryption and understand the response with decryption, etc. It will also provide various information on API usage, schema, masters, mapping, etc. \nTo understand more about what are APIs – the API interface is a site-to-site integration of two systems. Using this, the taxpayer can link his ERP system with the e-invoice system to generate IRNs (e-invoices) directly from his ERP, without the need to key in data in the e-invoice form on the portal. This integration reduces duplicate data entry and eliminates data entry errors. For the e-invoice generation process to run smoothly, the government has mandated that all e-invoicing eligible businesses who wish to integrate their ERP systems with the e-invoice portal should carry out sandbox testing and submit the report for the same.\nOne way to carry out sandbox testing for your business is to take on the services of a GSP/ASP (GST Suvidha Provider/Application Service Provider), who will integrate your ERP system with the e-invoice portal, fulfil the IT regulatory requirements set by the NIC, carry out sandbox testing and get your organisation e-invoicing ready.\nThe other way is to directly integrate your ERP with the e-invoice portal and carry out the sandbox testing on your own. This can be done by visiting the sandbox testing portal and following the given instructions.\nIf you do not wish to integrate your ERP, you can also generate e-invoices using the bulk-generation Excel tool offered by the e-invoice portal. You will need to visit the e-invoice portal, and navigate to ‘Help’ -> ‘Tools’ -> ‘Bulk Generation Tools’ and enter the required information to download the tool.\n2. How can I get to know if a particular supplier is required to issue an e-invoice?\nThe obligation to issue e-invoices according to the terms of Rule 48(4) lies with the concerned taxpayer. However, any person can search for the status of enablement of a GSTIN on the e-invoice portal. Navigate to ‘Search’ -> ‘e-invoice status of the taxpayer’. \nThis listing of GSTINs is based solely on the turnover reported in GSTR-3B. This means that the list could also contain entities that are either exempt from e-invoicing or entities for whom e-invoicing is not applicable for some other reason. Hence, the e-invoice portal’s enablement status does not necessarily mean that the taxpayer is supposed to issue an e-invoice. \nThe taxpayer’s turnover slab can also be ascertained by navigating through the ‘Search Taxpayer’ / ‘Know Your Supplier’ sections on the GST portal. \nIf a registered person is required to issue e-invoices in accordance with Rule 48(4) but has not been enabled yet on the portal, he may request enablement by navigating to ‘Registration’ -> ‘e-Invoice Enablement’.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

Are all businesses with turnover exceeding Rs.500 crore expected to comply with the provisions of the Dynamic QR Code?\nAns: The provisions of the Dynamic QR Code will apply to businesses with turnover exceeding Rs.500 crore in any financial year, from the financial year 2017-18 onwards. \nHowever, invoices issues by certain classes of taxpayers mentioned below are not required to generate Dynamic QR Codes:\n2. Will the Dynamic QR Code need to be generated on export invoices?\nAns: Though exports are made by a registered person to an unregistered person, the provisions of the Dynamic QR Code will not apply. This is because e-invoices need to be generated for export invoices.\n3. What details will the Dynamic QR Code contain?\nAns: The Dynamic QR Code will contain:\n4. In a situation where a Dynamic QR Code has been provided, but the customer makes payment without using it, will it be treated as compliance with the Dynamic QR Code requirements?\nAns: Yes, the invoice will be deemed to have complied with the Dynamic QR Code requirements if the supplier has issued an invoice containing a Dynamic QR Code.\nBesides, in the following cases, if the supplier has digitally displayed the Dynamic QR Code, the provisions are also said to be complied with, if-\n5. In a situation where a supplier provides digital modes of collecting payments, such as UPI Collect, UPI Intent, etc. through a mobile or computer-based application, and the Dynamic QR Code is not displayed. Still, instead, the details of the merchant and the transaction details are displayed, will it be treated as compliance with the Dynamic QR Code requirements?\nAns: If a cross-reference can be provided on the invoice about the payment made using such electronic modes of payment, the invoice will be deemed to have complied with the Dynamic QR Code requirements.\nHowever, if the payment is being made after the generation/issuance of the invoice, then the invoice is required to contain the Dynamic QR Code.\n6. In a situation where the payment for an invoice has been made before the invoice has been issued, then is the generation/printing of the Dynamic QR Code on the invoice mandatory?\nAns: No, the generation/printing of the Dynamic QR Code on an invoice is not required in cases where the payment has been made before the issuance of the invoice. However, a cross-reference needs to be provided on the invoice of the payment made through cash/electronic mode or a combination of both.

Will suppliers who sell through e-commerce operators or any other online applications be required to comply with the Dynamic QR Code requirements if the e-commerce operator/online application has already complied with the same?\nAns: The Dynamic QR Code requirements will apply to each supplier individually, depending on their turnover and type of business. Hence, if a supplier is able to provide a cross-reference on the invoice of the payment received with regard to the said invoice, then the invoice will be deemed to be compliant with Dynamic QR Code requirements. \nHowever, if the payment is being made after the generation/issuance of the invoice, then the invoice is required to contain the Dynamic QR Code.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

I had not opted for quarterly filing under the QRMP Scheme. Why has this option been automatically selected for me? How can I opt-out now?\nAnswer: If you’re a registered person under GST having a turnover up to Rs.1.5 crore and you were filing your GSTR-1 monthly, then you would have been automatically opted-in to the QRMP Scheme. Also, if your turnover was above Rs.1.5 crore but up to Rs.5 crore in the previous financial year, the quarterly filing option would have been selected on your behalf. The GST system had sent out emails and SMSes to taxpayers informing them about this automated selection.\nIf you now wish to opt-out, i.e., select the monthly filing option, you can do so by following the steps below:\nStep 1: Visit the GST portal, and navigate to ‘Returns’ > ‘Opt-in for quarterly filing’. \nStep 2: Select the relevant financial year and click on ‘Search’.\nStep 3: The quarter for which you can make changes to the filing frequency will be highlighted in green. Select the ‘monthly’ filing option. (Note that if you are already opted-in for monthly filing and wish to change to quarterly, you can do so here).\nStep 4: Click on the ‘Save’ button. A confirmation message will pop-up. Click ‘Ok’ to confirm your selection. \nNote: The window to opt-in or out of the QRMP Scheme is open only from the 1st day of the second month of the preceding quarter, and until the last day of the first month of the relevant quarter. Taxpayers can make changes only within this time period. \nFor example, for the quarter of January to March 2021, the last day to make changes was 31st January 2021.\n\n3. If I have opted into the QRMP Scheme and filing quarterly returns, is it mandatory that I furnish my sales invoices in the Invoice Furnishing Facility (IFF)?\nAnswer: No, the IFF is not a mandatory requirement for quarterly filers. It is optional to use and can be used by those taxpayers who wish to pass on the input tax credit (ITC) to their customers for the first two months of the quarter. \nSince the GSTR-1 return will be furnished only quarterly by taxpayers under the QRMP Scheme, it could lead to the recipients (customers) losing out on ITC for the first two months of the quarter. Hence, the government has introduced the IFF facility, as the invoices furnished in the IFF will reflect in the GSTR-2A and GSTR-2B of the recipients. The recipients can claim ITC based on this.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

Once the supplier receives the signed e-invoice from the IRP, the responsibility is on the supplier to share the e-invoice to his customers. \nIs the supplier’s signature or digital signature required on an e-invoice, while issuing a copy to the recipient?\nThe provisions of Rule 46 of the Central Goods and Services (CGST) Rules, 2017 apply here. According to Rule 46, the signature/digital signature of the supplier or his authorised representative is required while issuing invoices. However, a proviso to Rule 46 states that the signature/digital signature shall not be required in the case of issuance of an electronic invoice that is in accordance with the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000.\nHence, it has been interpreted that in the case of e-invoices, a supplier will not be required to sign/digitally sign the document.\nFor businesses to whom e-invoicing applies, is carrying a print out of the e-invoice while transporting goods mandatory?\nNo, a print out is not mandatory to be carried, as long as the e-invoice containing the IRN and QR code, can be electronically produced before the tax officer, for verification. These provisions are governed by Rule 138A(2) of CGST Rules.\nCan a supplier add more than one QR code on an e-invoice?\nYes, the supplier is free to add more QR codes to the e-invoice depending on his business needs or statutory requirements, apart from the QR code issued by the IRP.

Is there a capital loss on the sale of the motor car? \nThe motor car kept by you for your personal use is a ‘personal asset’ for tax purposes. A ‘personal asset’ does not fall under the purview of a ‘capital asset’. Also, the use of your car for employment does not make it a capital asset either. You are not entitled to depreciation on your personal motor car. Hence, the car is also not a depreciable asset giving rise to capital gains.

Any deferment in paying the advance tax instalments give rise to interest liability 1% p.m. under section 234C. The penal interest under section 234C gets calculated only until 31 March 2020. \nIn addition to interest under section 234C, you are liable to pay interest under section 234B if the TDS amount falls short of 90% of the tax due.

What happens if I have not generated e-invoices for October 2020?\nThe government has provided relaxation to taxpayers who fall under the ambit of Phase I of e-invoicing, which came into force from 1st October 2020. Some of these taxpayers were still not ready with their e-invoicing systems in place due to the pandemic and the resulting lockdown. Hence, the relaxation has been given as a last chance for the invoices raised by these notified taxpayers for October 2020.\nAll notified taxpayers who have not followed the e-invoicing procedure of uploading details of invoices on the e-invoice portal (IRP), obtaining the IRN and issuing the invoices with QR Code will be deemed to be valid and no penalty will be applicable, as long as the IRN for such invoices is obtained within 30 days of the date of the invoice.\nAlso Read: Now, Turnover From FY 17-18 to Be Considered for e-Invoicing\n2. Is there a facility to upload all my invoices in one go into the e-invoice portal, and generate the IRNs in bulk?\nYes, the e-invoice portal (IRP) has provided a bulk generation facility for taxpayers to upload multiple invoices at once. An Excel-based offline tool can be downloaded from the portal, where invoice data can be exported from the taxpayer’s ERP software in offline mode.\nThe IRP will then accept a bulk request for uploading the JSON files of these invoices. A bulk generation facility helps in generating multiple IRNs at a time, as well as in avoiding data entry mistakes such as the duplication of data. It is useful for taxpayers who do not wish to invest in an ERP integration with the e-invoicing portal.

There are some exceptions listed out such as Sections 10(3), 25, 27, 31, 37, 47, 50, 69, 90, 122, 129 and more of the CGST Act, presented in detail in our published article on the exceptions where GST relief does not get extended. \nThe notification number 55/2020 provided a further extension to the above relief. The period of relief earlier until 29th June 2020 has been extended until 30th August 2020. Accordingly, the last date to finish any pending compliance due from 20th March 2020 to 30th August 2020 is 31st August 2020.\nFrom the above notification, it is evident that the application for claiming GST refund can be filed on or before 31st August 2020 where the due date is expiring between 20th March 2020 and 30th August 2020. It is because this action is within the scope of the notification without exception.\nIn support of the above interpretation, there is also a CGST circular issued by the CBIC. It is CGST circular 137/07/2020-GST dated 13th April 2020. On referring to the serial number 6 of the circular, the same question has been answered in affirmative. \nHence, the application cannot be rejected merely on the ground that it has been filed beyond two years from the relevant date if it has been submitted within the extended deadline, as explained above.\nAlso Read: 41st GST Council Meet: 2 Options Offered to Meet the Compensation Cess Shortfall\nThe due date for claiming refund of GST has been laid down under Section 54 of the CGST Act. The subsection (1) states that the taxpayer who wants to claim the refund of tax and interest, if any, paid under certain types of transactions, elaborated in the further subsections, must submit an application within two years from the relevant date. \nThe relevant date can vary with every transaction, not known in this case. It will be the date of reporting the deemed export in GSTR-3B, and the date of dispatch in post or departure of the ship or aircraft or vehicle passing the frontier for export of goods with tax payment. \nWhereas, the relevant date in case of export of services with payment of tax can be either invoice date or payment receipt date, depending upon the time of supply. Further, the relevant date in case of a refund of unutilised input tax credit due to export without payment of tax or inverted structure shall be the end of that financial year. In other cases, it is the date of payment or adjustment of tax.\nIn this case, the relevant date falls in the Q4 of 2017-18, i.e. January 2018 to March 2018). Hence, two years from the applicable date happens to fall between January 2020 to March 2020.  \nCGST notifications- 35/2020 and 55/2020, providing an extension to comply or complete actions, will apply partially in this case. January 2020 to March 2020 will be split into two parts as follows 1st January 2020 to 19th March 2020 and 20th March 2020 to 31st March 2020.\nThe ultimate deadlines after considering the above notifications will be as follows:\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at annapoorna.m@cleartax.in\nAnnapoorna, popularly known as Anna, is an aspiring Chartered Accountant with a flair for GST.

        "data": "1. I have purchased a residential apartment, currently under construction by the builder. Is GST applicable on this residential property and at what rate?\nAns: If a residential property has been purchased while under construction, GST will be applicable on the same. The rates with effect from 1st April 2019, on new residential projects and ongoing residential projects which have opted for the revised rates, are:\n– Ongoing affordable housing projects opting for the revised rates#\n– Ongoing projects other than affordable housing projects opting for the revised rates#\n– Projects with commercial space <15% of total carpet area\n*Affordable housing projects are housing projects with carpet areas of up to 60 sq. m and 90 sq, m. in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas respectively, with the gross amount charged by the builder not exceeding Rs.45 lakh in either case.\n#Previously, the rate was 8% on affordable housing projects and 12% on other than affordable housing projects, with input tax credit available.\nThere are certain conditions to be followed for builders to charge GST on the revised rates:\nThe builder will need to pay GST at the rate of 18% on a reverse-charge basis on all inward supplies, to the extent it falls short of 80% of purchases made from registered suppliers. GST on cement will need to be paid at a rate of 28% (if purchased from unregistered persons).\nIt is important to note that GST will not be applicable on ready-to-move (RTM) properties, for which the completion certificate has been issued. This is because the sale of a property is neither treated as a supply of goods or supply of services under Schedule III of the CGST Act, 2017.\nAlso Read: Tax Query: Can I claim deduction for expenses from commission income?\n2. If I have paid stamp duty on my residential property, will GST still be applicable?\nAns: Stamp duty is a duty levied by the State Governments on property transactions and legal documents. GST is an indirect tax levied by the Central Government, applicable on almost all goods and services in India. Both are governed under different laws. \nStamp duty will be applicable on both completed properties and under-construction properties, as was the case in the pre-GST regime.

Do note that the lower TDS benefit is for professional fee dues from 14 May 2020 until 31 March 2020. \nThe threshold limit for the deduction of tax (TDS) continues to be the same at Rs 30,000. Hence, if the payments you make exceed Rs 30,000 in a financial year, you have to deduct tax. In a case your liability to TDS arises on or after 14 May 2020, TDS rate applicable is 7.5%.\nAlso Read: Tax Query: Can I continue with my LIC policy under the new tax regime?\nI am a salaried employee. My monthly salary payment is liable to TDS. I understand that the government has recently announced a reduction in TDS rates. I wish to know whether there is a reduction in TDS on my salary payments? Also, I have fixed deposits with banks with annual interest receipt of Rs 50,000. Will there be a reduction in the TDS on interest receipts?\nThe government announced a reduction in TDS rates for specified payments such as interest, professional fee, contractual payments and others. However, the reduction in TDS rates does not apply to payments under salaries. Your salary income is liable to TDS as per the income tax slab rates. There is no alteration in the income tax slab rates as part of the stimulus package. Hence, the TDS on salary payments continues as per your income slabs either under the existing tax regime or new tax regime, as you may choose for FY 2020-21. \nThe reduction in TDS rate applies to interest payments by banks. Your interest income from bank FDs will be liable to lower TDS rate of 7.5% for interest credited on and after 14 May 2020 until 31 March 2021.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at sweta.dugar@cleartax.in\nI am a Chartered Accountant by profession.

Apart from this, I make a yearly contribution to my EPF account of Rs 21,600. I understand that till FY 2019-20, I can claim a tax deduction for the payments. Also, from FY 2020-21, I will not get a tax deduction under the new tax regime.

Here, it is essential to note that in addition to the tax deduction, you can also claim tax-exemption on the maturity proceeds of your LIC policy.

You can claim a deduction in FY 2019-20 only for the EMIs that are due by 31 March 2020. That means you can claim a deduction only for the interest which falls due as part of outstanding EMIs as on 31 March 2020.

Is it tax beneficial to invest in the bonds or fixed deposits? \nYour investment in the 7.75% Savings (Taxable) Bonds entitles you to interest on a half-yearly basis, on 31 January and 31 July.

When a long-term capital asset is transferred (sold), the resulting figure is long-term capital gains (LTCG) or loss (LTCL). \nTo calculate the amount of taxes on the capital gains earned, you need to be aware of the fair market value of your flat as on the 1st of April 2001. This amount will be adjusted with the inflation using the cost inflation index (CII) of FY 2019-20 which is 289. The indexed cost of acquisition will be deducted from the net sale proceeds (sale after adjusting any brokerage or other expenses directly connected to sale). In case of any positive amount, 20% tax will be applicable (plus surcharge and cess). If the calculation results in a loss, the same will be set off against another LTCG or carried forward to the future years.\nAlso Read: Tax Query: Interest From NRE FD Account Not Taxable for an NRI\nHere’s the calculation for the capital gains after considering the senior citizens’ basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh: \n[2,75,000*289/100]\nThere are certain capital gains exemptions available under the income tax provisions that can help you save your taxes.

He wants to open a fixed deposit and is confused whether such deposit will be taxable. What will happen when he returns to India and become a resident again?\nUnder income tax laws, any interest received by an individual from NRE accounts is exempt from income tax in India, provided that the individual qualifies as a ‘person resident outside India’ under the exchange control law. You need to know that the provisions determining the residential status under exchange control law are different from the income tax law. \nAccording to the exchange control law, when an individual leaves India for the purpose of employment, for establishing a business, or for any other purpose indicating his intention to stay outside India for an uncertain period, he will be considered as a ‘person resident outside India’. In addition, when such an individual returns to India permanently, he may be considered as a ‘person resident in India’. Therefore, if Mr Ram opens an FD with an NRE account, the interest income will be exempt from income tax only. This is possible only if he qualifies as a ‘person resident outside India’. \nAlso Read: Tax Query: How much money can be gifted to parents under IT laws?\nFurther, NRE accounts are designated as resident accounts. The funds held in such accounts may be transferred to Resident Foreign Currency (RFC) accounts immediately when the account holder returns to India permanently. \nSimilarly, when he returns to India, he will be required to designate the NRE account as ‘Resident’ or transfer it to RFC account and, then, the interest earned on the same will be taxable in India. However, he can claim a deduction of up to Rs 50,000 under Section 80TTB from the interest income earned from FDs, provided he qualifies as a senior resident of India (more than 60 years of age).\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at komal.chawla@cleartax.in.\nI am an aspiring Chartered Accountant.

In case, you had completed five years of continuous service with your employer, your PF corpus would have enjoyed a tax exemption on the withdrawal.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Intraday trading relates to purchasing and selling stocks within the same trading day before the stock market closes. Stocks are purchased with the motive of earning profits in a short term. Investments is not the objective. This is undertaken by capitalising on the movement of stock indices. The varied prices of the stocks are harnessed in order to earn profits from the trading of stocks.\nAn online trading account is required to be set up with relevant orders, which are explicit to intraday trading. In case a trader fails to close their position within the day, it will be automatically squared off by their stockbroker at the closing time. Intraday trades are purely driven by profits. \nOn the other hand, unlike intraday trading, delivery trading involves no time constraints in the selling of stocks. In delivery trading, shares bought can be maintained for a longer duration to rake in higher profit returns. The stocks a trader buys are added to the demat (dematerialised) account. The stocks remain in the possession of the trader until they decide to sell them. A trader enjoys complete ownership of the stocks. A delivery trade cannot be performed without a demat account.\nIntraday trading involves judging and forecasting the value of shares at short and small intervals. There are technical tools available that can be deployed in predicting short-term price movements.\nDelivery trading involves long-term investing, a trader needs to pick shares based on a company’s intrinsic value and relatable assessments, which are a particular company’s fundamental indicators such as price-to-earnings ratio and book value, among others.\nRajiv is an independent editorial consultant for the last decade.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "1. Hi. I am a dealer supplying goods with a registered office in Bangalore. ABC Ltd., based in Karnataka, recently made a purchase for Rs.1 lakh and instructed me to ship it to a warehouse in Tamil Nadu. Will I need to raise an invoice charging CGST/SGST or charging IGST?\nAnswer: This will be a ‘bill to ship to’ transaction case. ‘Bill to ship to’ transactions involve three parties – the supplier, the recipient and the third person. The goods are shipped to the recipient by the supplier on the instructions of a third person. The first part of the transaction will be between the supplier and the third person. The next will be between the third person and the recipient. GST is charged to both recipients depending on their places of business. \nIn this situation, you are the supplier, the warehouse in Tamil Nadu is the recipient, and ABC Ltd. is the third person. The first invoice raised by you to ABC Ltd. will need to have state tax (SGST) and central tax (CGST) charged as it is an intra-state supply. The second invoice raised by ABC Ltd. to the company based in Tamil Nadu will have integrated GST (IGST) charged as it is an interstate transaction.\n2. Hello. I purchased a house property under construction a couple of years ago, but the project was never completed. The builder has agreed to refund the amount paid to me, excluding the GST portion, as the same has already been paid to the government. Is there a way for me to claim this GST paid? \nAnswer: The CBIC recently released a circular detailing the process where a GST refund can be claimed by unregistered persons under two scenarios. One of them includes cases where a construction contract has been cancelled for reasons such as non-completion or delay. In such cases, the buyer may receive a refund from the builder without GST as the same would have already been paid to the government, and the time limit for issuing a credit note would have also expired.\nIn this case, you can file a refund application on the common GST portal by obtaining a temporary GST registration. You will need to select the same state/Union Territory as the supplier in respect of whose invoices you are filing the refund application. After you log in, go to Services -> Refunds -> Application for Refund. Under refund type, select ‘Refund for Unregistered Taxpayer’. Proceed to fill in the necessary details and upload the relevant documents.\nPlease note that you will also need to complete the mandatory Aadhaar authentication and provide the bank account details that are in your name and obtained using your PAN.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "headline": "Taxes in 2023: A List of Expectations From Budget 2023",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "With every January comes new hopes and expectations, amongst them being a Union Budget wishlist for businesspersons, salaried individuals, and finance experts alike. Of course, the long-standing goals are always lower tax rates, tax savings, and ease of compliance. This year, too, is no different. Let’s take a look at the biggest expectations surrounding direct and indirect taxes in 2023.\nExpectations of the common man\nThe basic exemption limit has not changed for close to ten years now. The government instead gradually increased the amount of rebate a taxpayer can claim on incomes earned below Rs.5 lakh per annum. A new tax regime was also introduced but did not find favour amongst most taxpayers due to the complicated structure and lack of deductions. \nThis year, what taxpayers really hope to see is an increase in the basic exemption limit to Rs.5 lakh to relieve taxpayers earning an income up to this extent from having to file their returns and claim a rebate. The 80C deduction limit has also been stagnant for nearly a decade, and taxpayers and experts are hoping to see the Rs.1.5 limit raised to at least Rs.2.5 lakh this year. On the health insurance front, having separate deductions for premiums paid and medical expenses would be a welcome measure. \nAnother major change taxpayers wish to see is an increase in the Public Provident Fund or PPF limit. At present, individuals can invest up to Rs.1.5 lakh every financial year, and there has been no change in the limit of this popular investment option for years. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has recently recommended in the pre-Budget memorandum that this limit be upped to Rs.3 lakh. This move would be particularly advantageous to non-salaried taxpayers who do not have the option of investing via the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), coupled with an equal contribution from the respective employer.\nThe ICAI has also asked for a separate deduction to be allowed for payments relating to other insurance premiums paid, such as home insurance, travel insurance, personal accident insurance, etc., in a bid to push taxpayers to invest in security.\nWhen it comes to House Rent Allowance (HRA), taxpayers enjoy an income tax deduction based on a set of rules that vary depending on whether the taxpayer is from a metro or non-metro city. However, the metro cities in question were only limited to New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. Now, experts opine that the ‘50% of basic salary + dearness allowance’ rule should also be extended to other major metro cities such as Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Gurgaon, and Hyderabad, amongst others, given the skyrocketing rents in these cities.\nLikewise, an increase in the rent limit under Section 80GG to Rs.10,000 should also be considered, given that rents in most cities in India are now several times the current limit of Rs.5,000. \nMoving from rent to the purchase of a home, the financial year ended 2022 was to be the last year for taxpayers to claim a deduction under Section 80EEA, i.e. an additional Rs.1.5 lakh deduction for first-time home buyers. Taxpayers are expecting at least a two-year extension for this deduction. \nSimilarly, given the booming electric vehicle (EV) industry and the need for sustainable green energy vehicles, taxpayers hope that the deduction under Section 80EEB of Rs.1.5 lakh will also be given a two-year extension.\nFinally, to round up the list of major personal tax expectations from Budget 2023 are the requests by senior citizens to make pension earned exempt under the Income Tax Law, given that it’s the only source of income and security for many senior citizens. It is also expected that Budget 2023 will put senior and super senior citizens on a similar footing by increasing the tax exemption slab for senior citizens to Rs.5 lakh as well.\nSimplification of the capital gains tax structure\nCapital gains tax in India is currently very complicated, with different holding periods mentioned for different classes of assets to identify whether the capital gains earned are long-term or short-term and whether indexation benefits are available. Once identified, there are different tax rates and surcharges applicable to these gains. With this Budget, investors are hoping for a simpler capital gains tax system, which should reduce litigation and disputes arising on the matter.\nUniformity in the corporate tax rate\nCurrently, different sectors in India are taxed at different income tax rates. To position India as a competitive hub for both manufacturing and services industries, companies are advocating for the introduction of a uniform corporate tax rate of 15%. This would not only bolster the manufacturing sector but also allow the service sector to thrive. \nThat said, concessional tax regimes are offered for both companies and individuals. However, partnership firms and LLPs are still taxable at a flat rate of 30%. Hence, the government could consider introducing a similar concessional rate for them.\nClarity on cryptocurrency laws\nIn addition to modifying the tax slabs and rate structure, individuals and businesses alike are hoping to gain clarity in this Budget on cryptocurrency laws in India. While the government introduced taxes on digital assets for the first time last year, there is an absence of regulatory guidelines in the industry. The implementation of structured laws surrounding the trade of digital assets will protect investors and prevent any illegal dealings from taking place.\nThe main aim of the government in this Budget should be to widen the taxpayer base rather than impose stringent rules and surcharges on existing taxpayers. India has a very low taxpayer base, and the government should make optimum use of technology in order to change this. Potential taxpayers must be encouraged to file their tax returns, a move that will take slightly more effort in light of the recent pandemic and rising inflation. Measures such as simplification of the existing tax structure, the merging of surcharges into the tax rate, or the introduction of a flat tax rate might help to widen the taxpayer net.\nAn overhaul of the indirect tax system?\nIt’s been over five years since GST was implemented in India, and every year since then, GST taxpayers have been hit by a series of unending amendments to the GST law. Some of the biggest reforms in GST have been by way of introducing stringent restrictions on input tax credit (ITC) claims and by introducing the e-invoicing system. \nGiven how well both the GST and e-invoicing law has been working for both businesses in India and the government, it is unlikely that Budget 2023 will see an overhaul of the indirect tax law or even any major reforms. Though there has been pressure to merge the 12% and 18% tax slabs in order to decrease the total number of slabs under GST, it is unlikely that Budget 2023 will see this move happen.\nInstead, what businesses can expect to see in Budget 2023 with regard to indirect taxes are amendments to the GST Act based on recent recommendations by the GST Council in the Council meetings, especially around matters surrounding the decriminalisation of offences under the GST law. \nBesides certain tweaks to the GST law, there could be rate rationalisation to correct matters such as the inverted duty structure on certain goods and services. \nThere have also been certain industry expectations on the GST front, such as a uniform GST rate levy of 12% on all hotel rooms, as well as a full set-off of input tax credit. The EV industry has asked for a 5% GST to be levied on lithium-ion batteries as against the existing rate of 18% in a bid to increase demand for electric vehicles through lower tax rates and hence lower prices. The healthcare sector, too, is expecting to see a decrease in the GST rate on medical insurance premiums from 18% to 5%, given the pressing need for insurance in a post-pandemic world.\nThere have also been several long, drawn-out disputes and litigations under the Customs law. This Budget, it would be a worthwhile move for the government to launch a one-time amnesty scheme for customs to settle these prolonged disputes.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

        "data": "Next month, the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) will develop a revised incentive structure for the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for IT hardware to scale up domestic production and make it attractive for global players to relocate units from China.\nThe idea is to offer higher incentives and engage in fresh consultations with the industry so that a few prominent players who have not participated in the scheme can develop their India manufacturing plans.\nThe Success of PLI Scheme for Hardware\nGlobal players like HP and Dell, which already had some production units in India, have sent applications for the PLI IT hardware scheme since its announcement in February 2021. However, this scheme has not been as successful as the smartphone PLI scheme.\nFor instance, the smartphone’s quarterly production under PLI averages Rs.67,200 crore against the quarterly estimate of Rs.43,000 crore and attracted an investment of Rs.2,600 crore. But the IT hardware’s quarterly average production is at Rs.500 crore against the estimated Rs.750 crore and attracted investments of Rs.16,500 crore.\nProblems With the PLI Scheme for Hardware\nThere were problems from the start with the IT hardware scheme. When the government announced this scheme on 24 February 2021, the outlay was fixed at Rs.7,350 crore over four years. The government estimated production of up to Rs.3.26 lakh crore, out of which exports were expected to be of the order of Rs.2.45 lakh crore.\nOn 4 May 2021, the government announced the names of the companies that applied for the scheme, and it slashed the production target to Rs.1.60 lakh crore, of which exports would be Rs.60,000 crore.\nSince the incentive structure is based on attaining a minimum threshold of incremental sales over the base year increasing to a maximum limit, the outlay of Rs.7,350 crore for the scheme was cut back by half as companies committed to a lower production target.\nThe IT hardware manufacturers blamed the low production target on the incentive structure. The incentive works out to an average of 2-2.5% over four years, which does not justify relocating units from China or Vietnam, especially for hardware products where the import duties are nil as they fall under IT products.\nThe industry executives feel that the ideal incentive structure for IT hardware should be in the range of 7-8%. For companies like HP and Dell, who have participated in the IT hardware PLI scheme, the domestic sales are more attractive than the exports, which is the main driving force for the government behind redesigning the PLI scheme.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at mayashree.acharya@cleartax.in\nI am an Advocate by profession.

        "data": "The GST Council may increase the 5% GST slab to 8% in its next council meeting, according to a report by the PTI news agency. At present, the GST slabs stand at 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, apart from exempted, nil-rated, and high-valued goods like jewellery and precious stones. A report has said that the lowest tax slab of 5% will likely be raised to 8% in a bid to increase the annual GST revenues. \nA panel of state finance ministers will submit its report by the end of the month to the Council, which will comprise various steps to boost revenues. One of the measures includes hiking the lowest slab of 5% and rationalising the slab. According to the agency, the increase in the lowest slab will result in additional annual revenue of Rs.1.5 lakh crore.\nThe Group of Ministers (GoM), headed by Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, is also looking at creating a three-tiered rate structure under GST consisting of 8%, 18% and 28% slabs. This means that they could also merge the 12% and 18% slabs. If this proposal were accepted, all goods currently in the 12% slab would move to the 18% slab. The GoM is also considering reducing the number of exemptions under GST and bringing the same under the various tax slabs.\n1st July 2022 will mark five years since the implementation of GST. The Centre imposed a compensation cess on luxury and sin goods over five years at the time of implementation. This was to protect the states’ revenue of 14% per annum over the base year revenue of 2015-16. \nWith the compensation regime coming to an end, the states will need to become self-sufficient. However, the 15.3% revenue-neutral rate estimated at the time of implementation of GST has come down to 11.6% over the past five years. This could be due to the reduction of GST on several goods. For example, 228 goods were attracting a GST rate of 28% when introducing GST. This number has come down to less than 35. Hence, according to a source, the only way to maintain revenue neutrality is by rationalising the tax slabs.\nSources have said that the GST Council is expected to meet either later this month or early next month to discuss the GoM report and to take a view on the revenue position of the states.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, don’t hesitate to contact the writer at athena.rebello@cleartax.in.\nI’m a Chartered Accountant by profession and a writer by passion.

He further noted that the trouble in the economy had got nothing to do with the pandemic. \nAn accommodative monetary policy means there is a risk of only low growth and low inflation, which Varma thinks is not true anymore. He fears that we are risking falling behind the curve. He feels that the circumstances tomorrow might need a change in the policy rate, but the RBI has more or less stated they will not change the rate.\nVerma stated that the RBI must maintain its freedom of action in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the looming risks to the global economy. He feels that there is no certainty of what will hit the economy and from where. Therefore, he expressed discomfort about the RBI’s commitment to what it will do in the future.\nOn the take on RBI keeping its reverse repo rate unchanged at 3.35%, used to drain excess funds from leaders, while holding variable reverse repo rate auctions at 3.99%, Varma stated there was a disconnect between the RBI’s words and actions.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at mayashree.acharya@cleartax.in.\nI am an Advocate by profession.

Previously, the PFRDA chairman mentioned that such schemes in mutual funds and insurance had not performed well.\nGuaranteed products within the insurance industry were discontinued as providing a guarantee for a long duration may not be in the best interests of an organisation. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) also does not motivate any guaranteed product. As soon as a guarantee was provided, capital adequacy needs concerning fund managers went up.\nThe moment a guarantee is rendered, the markets decline; thus, fund managers will need to bring in more capital. Hence, actuarial inputs are needed. There will be different charge structures, not just capital needs, and there should be a separate guarantee fee. An ideal guarantee fee needs to be determined.\nIn comparison to other schemes, NPS has earned higher returns. For example, central government employees have earned returns ranging between 9.68% and 9.93% since its inception. State government employees have earned returns of 9.61% to -9.69%. These returns are higher in comparison to 8.5% returns earned via the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) for 2020-21.

No deduction for any expenditure shall be allowed from the same, except the acquisition cost. It further specifies that loss arising from the transfer of virtual digital assets cannot be adjusted against any other income, and it cannot be carried forward to subsequent years.\nAnother provision (Section 194S) is also inserted to deduct TDS at 1% at the time of payment on transfer of virtual digital assets where the amount is above the specified threshold limit.\nThe Finance Minister has further proposed to fully tax the gifts received in the form of virtual digital assets in the hands of the recipient. \nReduced AMT and Surcharge Rates for Co-operative Societies\nThe budget 2022 has reduced the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) to 15% of the adjusted total income from the current rate of 18.5% to provide parity in tax rates between co-operative societies and companies. It has further capped the surcharge at 7% for the co-operative societies with total income above Rs 1 crore and up to Rs 10 crore. \nNPS deduction to State government employees \nThe State government employees will now be able to claim deduction under Section 80CCD(2) for NPS contribution by the employer up to 14% of their basic salary and dearness allowance, which is in line with the deduction available to the Central government employees under the said section.\nTax Relief to the Persons with Disability\nCurrently, Section 80DD provides a tax deduction to the parents or guardians of the disabled person who have paid any amount under the insurance scheme specified in the said section. The said deduction is available only if such insurance scheme provides for the payment of annuity and lump sum amount to the differently-abled person on the death of the subscriber. The said section is amended to include insurance schemes that allow the payment of annuity and lump sum amount to the differently-abled dependant during the lifetime of the parent and guardians on attaining their age of sixty years or more, and the payment or deposit to such scheme has been discontinued. \nStart-ups Tax Incentive Period Extended \nCiting the start-ups as drivers for the economy’s growth, the benefit of tax incentives under Section 80-IAC was available to the start-ups that were incorporated up to 31st March 2022. However, the benefit of tax incentives is further extended to start-ups incorporated up to 31st March 2023. \nClarification for Allowability of Surcharge and Cess\nIt is further clarified that the surcharge and cess on income and profits will not be allowed as business expenditure.\nKey Changes in GST\nAmendments in Customs \nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at namita.shah@cleartax.in.\nI’m a chartered accountant and a functional CA writer by profession.  Reading and travelling in free time enhances my creativity in work.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "The pension and pensioners’ welfare department issued an office memorandum regarding the coverage under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 in place of the National Pension System (NPS) for the Central Government employees whose appointments were finalised before 01.01.2004 but joined government service after 01.01.2004.\nOne-Time Pension Under the OPS\nThe pension and pensioners’ welfare department provided a one-time pension option to the Central Government employees under the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) in place of NPS. The department provided the option of a one-time pension to those employees declared successful for retirement in the results declared before 31.12.2003 against vacancies occurring before 01.01.2004. These employees are also covered under the NPS upon joining service after 01.01.2004.\nThe department of pension and pensioners’ welfare noticed that despite the submission of options by the employees within the time limit prescribed, some offices may not have decided these options within the stipulated schedule of these activities. The department specified the cut-off dates for processing cases to ensure faster resolution of grievances of employees and its time-bound disposal.\nThe department’s latest note mentioned that the cut-off dates should not be taken as a reason not to process the option given by the employee within the due time. Therefore, it requested all ministries and departments to take the necessary action upon the exercise of options by the employees within a stipulated time.\nRequest for One-Time Pension\nAfter introducing the NPS, it mandatorily covers all Central Government employees appointed to the posts in the Central Government service (except armed forces) after 01.01.2004. The Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 and other related rules were also amended and made inapplicable to the Central Government employees appointed to the government services after 31.12.2003.\nHowever, the government received representations from the Central Government employees appointed after 1.1.2004 requesting to get the pension scheme’s benefit under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 on the ground of delay in their appointment due to administrative lapses or reasons.\nThus, the department of pension and pensioners’ welfare issued an office memorandum to provide a one-time pension option under the OPS in place of the NPS to the Central Government employees declared successful for retirement in the results declared before 31.12.2003.\nFor any clarifications/feedback on the topic, please contact the writer at mayashree.acharya@cleartax.in\nI am an Advocate by profession.

        "data": "Within the financial statements of a business, many financial transactions are recorded. Some are done only to keep track of the money, and some are highly crucial to understand the financial position of the company. One such crucial transaction that helps analyse business position effectively is the record of sundry creditors. Let us dive deeper into the article to understand what sundry debtors are, how it is recorded in different financial statements and why they are important for a business.What are Sundry Creditors?Sundry creditors are businesses or individuals who provide different services or goods on credit terms. They are also considered to be such individuals or companies to whom a certain business owes their money since the credit facility was availed against certain services or goods. Within a company, sundry creditors act as a liability since they owe a certain amount to another business due to a transaction. A credit payment timeline is agreed upon between two parties - the one that offers the goods or services and the company that is availing credit facility against goods or services supplied.Sundry Creditors is Which Type of Account?Sundry creditors, also known as accounts payable, fall under the liability account of a business. This is mainly because businesses supply services or goods in advance to other companies or individuals, and the payment is received later. The buyers tend to pay money to the seller later, and sundry creditors become the liability of the business. Thus, they are recorded under the 'liabilities' head of the balance sheet.How to Record Sundry Creditors?You can record sundry creditors in your business as a liability. It appears on the credit side of the balance sheet of the company. However, certain companies opt to use a separate category of account called sundry creditors account or accounts payable account to track any payments made against such transactions.Sundry Creditors Ledger Account FormatCreditors, classified as liabilities, maintain a positive credit balance within the accounts. Whenever credit purchases are conducted throughout a fiscal year, they are recorded as credits in creditors' accounts, thus contributing to an augmentation of creditors' balance. Conversely, any transactions that diminish the creditors' balance, such as payments to creditors or purchase returns, are recorded as debits.The format for ledger accounts related to sundry creditors is as follows - Sundry Creditors A/C\n| 0    | 1                                                     | 2           | 3    | 4                                                  | 5           |\n|:-----|:------------------------------------------------------|:------------|:-----|:---------------------------------------------------|:------------|\n| Dr.  | Dr.                                                   | Dr.         | Cr.  | Cr.                                                | Cr.         |\n| Date | Particulars                                           | Amount (Rs) | Date | Particulars                                        | Amount (Rs) |\n| nan  | To bank A/C                                           | ***         | nan  | By Balance b/d  (opening sundry creditors balance) | ***         |\n| nan  | To Purchase Return A/C                                | ***         | nan  | By Credit Purchases A/C                            | ***         |\n| nan  | To Bills Payable A/C                                  | ***         | nan  | nan                                                | ***         |\n| nan  | To Balance C/D  (closing balance of sundry creditors) | ***         | nan  | nan                                                | ***         |\n| nan  | nan                                                   | *****       | nan  | nan                                                | *****       |\nSundry Creditors ExamplesLet us consider an example to understand the transaction process of sundry creditors accurately.Let's contemplate a scenario where PBC Ltd. has made a purchase of goods from Jain Traders, incurring a total cost of Rs.12,000. This transaction, which took place on January 31 2023, requires PBC Ltd. to settle the bill by April 2, 2023. Maintaining a punctual payment record is crucial for PBC Ltd., as it plays a significant role in preserving its favourable credit rating. To account for this obligation, PBC Ltd. will appropriately log this transaction in their financial records under the \"Sundry Creditors\" ledger, categorising it as a liability of the business.Sundry Creditors in Balance SheetWithin the balance sheet, sundry creditors are reported in the liability section of the financial statement, specifically under the category' sundry creditor' or 'accounts payable'. The consideration in the balance sheet is a business liability since the amount represents the total sum owed by the business to different vendors or suppliers for all the services or goods received on credit. Sundry Creditors in Trial BalanceWhile preparing the trial balance of a business, the amount related to sundry creditors must be recorded on the credit side of the statement. As this account is a business liability, like other income or liabilities accounts, the amount is credited while proceeding with the steps in the trial balance.Sundry Creditors Journal EntryTrade payables or sundry creditors emerge from credit transactions, which are categorised as expenditures. Nevertheless, when the payment becomes due, it transforms into a liability for the entity. The journal entry that is used to record the sundry creditors showing credit purchase of any services or goods is given below -\n| 0    | 1                                                                                                | 2   | 3                 | 4                  |\n|:-----|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----|:------------------|:-------------------|\n| Date | Particulars                                                                                      | L/F | Debit Amount (Rs) | Credit Amount (Rs) |\n| nan  | Purchase A/C Dr.  To Sundry Creditors A/C  (Being goods purchased by sundry creditors on credit) | nan | *****             | *****              |\nDifference Between Sundry Creditors and Sundry DebtorsTo get a more accurate picture of what sundry creditors are and how they affect the business, it is important to have a clear understanding of the difference between sundry debtors' and creditors' accounts. Some key differences are discussed below.Sundry creditors are entities or individuals to whom a company owes money for goods or services received.

Whereas sundry debtors represent an asset on the company's balance sheet, signifying money receivable from others.In a balance sheet, you can find the recording of sundry creditors done under the 'liabilities' head, but sundry debtors are recorded in the 'assets' heading.To think about the function, sundry creditors reflect a company's outstanding obligations and the need to manage its payables efficiently.

        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Individuals or businesses purchase assets or collect funds to build projects by borrowing money from private lenders or banks. Such lending practice is known as financial leverage. Business owners get the opportunity to acquire capital or funds at short notice and are mostly helpful in business expansion.Let us dive deeper into this article to get a clear understanding of financial leverage, its formulas, types and ratios applied in the business.What Is Financial Leverage?Financial leverage is a process where businesses or individuals use loans to fund projects or acquire extra assets for the business. After the project or asset acquisition is complete, the borrower pays back the principal sum with the interest amount. The purpose of implementing financial leverage is different for different entities. In various scenarios, the debt provider puts a limit on the risk it is ready to take, indicating a specific limit on the leverage that would be allowed. What is Leverage in Financial Management?Leverage in financial management is a type of investment where money borrowed is used to get maximum return on investment or acquire additional assets for business expansion. Businesses create such debts by borrowing capital from different lenders and promising them to pay with additional interest after a specific time. In the financial management process of a company, the use of leverage acts as the reason to increase asset values, increase the shareholders' value and acquire new equipment. Nonetheless, individuals not wanting to get themselves involved in leveraging can invest in a business that uses leverage methods to complete organisational activities. Asset value and loan interest are the two main factors considered in this aspect.Significance of Financial LeverageThe aspect of financial leverage is significant since it empowers both individual investors and organisations to tap into investment opportunities that may surpass their existing cash reserves. Although this strategy entails a level of risk, it has the potential to foster business expansion, thereby generating additional employment opportunities and stimulating economic activity. Furthermore, it can enable nonprofit institutions such as hospitals and universities, which frequently contend with limited regular cash flow, to expand their operations and extend their reach to a larger audience.Types of Leverage In Financial ManagementThere are three main types of leverage used in the financial management process of an organisation. They are discussed as follows.Financial LeverageThis is the total debt a business acquires to fulfil different financial purposes. In the financial statements, this type of spoof leverage is represented under the list of liabilities. Financial leverage helps you to continue with your investments even if the business does not have enough cash. Equity financing is the most preferred option in this case, as it allows you to raise money without liquidating your ownership.Operating LeverageOperating leverage pertains to the combination of fixed and variable costs associated with delivering products and services. Fixed costs remain consistent, independent of output levels, necessitating payment whether a business is profitable or incurring losses. The assessment of operating leverage involves calculating the ratio between fixed and variable costs. If fixed expenses outweigh variable ones, a business exhibits high operating leverage. While this can enhance returns, excessive reliance on it escalates financial risk.Combined LeverageThis type of financial leverage accounts for the total risk of your business. Such leverage aggregates the effects of financial and operating leverage and presents a complete report of your business's financial position. Moreover, this leverage is generally used by capital-intensive companies that have the potential to expand but have low equity. Before applying combined leverage, always remember to study the market conditions and be sure of the future expenses of the business to avoid unnecessary risks.Financial Leverage Ratio FormulaYou can use many financial ratios to calculate your business's financial leverage. The common financial leverage ratios and formulas that you can implement are discussed below.Debt to Equity RatioThis ratio determines the total financial leverage of a business and shows the debt-to-equity proportion of the company. The result of this ratio helps the lenders, shareholders and management of the company to understand the risk level in the capital structure of the firm. The debt-to-equity ratio is calculated using this formula - Debt to Equity (D/E) Ratio = Total Debt ÷ Total EquityDebt to Capital RatioDebt to Capital ratio measures the financial leverage of a firm by comparing the debt of the business to its capital. Here, debts can be both short-term and long-term, and capital is the value of the total equity associated with debt and shareholders. The formula is - Debt to Capital Ratio = Debt ÷ (Debt + Shareholder’s Equity)Interest Coverage RatioThis financial leverage ratio adds context to the liabilities of the business by providing data to the analysts on how well the business can service the existing debts. Companies generally try to keep this ratio 3 or higher, but it depends on the industry as well. The formula of this ratio is - Interest Coverage Ratio = Operating Income ÷ Interest ExpensesDebt to EBITDA RatioWith this ratio, the analysis of how well the business can pay off its debts and how likely it can default in payment is assessed. EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. You can calculate this ratio using the following formula - Debt to EBITDA Ratio = Debt ÷ EBITDATotal Debt to Total Asset RatioAs per this financial leverage ratio, you can understand the degree to which the assets of the business are funded by taking debts. The formula is - Total Debt to Total Assets Ratio = Total Debts ÷ Total AssetsEquity MultiplierThe calculation of this ratio helps stakeholders of a firm understand the weightage of ownership in the business by analysing the way of financing assets. For a low equity multiplier, the business is considered to be financed largely with equity and is not considered a highly leveraged business. You can use this formula for calculation- Equity Multiplier = Total Assets ÷ Total EquityDegree of Financial LeverageThe degree of financial leverage or DFL is a financial leverage ratio that measures earnings per share or EPS of a business with fluctuation in operating income due to the change in capital structure. This ratio mainly denotes that higher financial leverage means the earnings will be volatile.The value of DFL is important to assess the valuation of financial leverage and determine how businesses can streamline processes to reduce monetary obligations. However, if the firm operates in such a sector where operating income is volatile, it is always recommended to limit debts to a manageable and easy level.The formula used to calculate this ratio is - DFL = % change in EPS ÷ change in EBITOr,DFL = EBIT ÷ (EBIT - Interest)*EBIT means Earnings Before Interest and TaxDifference Between Operating Leverage and Financial LeverageThe differences between operating and financial leverage are represented in the table below.\n| 0           | 1                                                                                                            | 2                                                                                                        |\n|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Category    | Financial Leverage                                                                                           | Operating Leverage                                                                                       |\n| Meaning     | This is the ability of a business to use its capital to earn better returns as well as reduce tax liability. | This is the ability of a company to use the existing fixed costs of the firm to generate higher returns. |\n| Measurement | It measures the financial risk within the company.                                                           | It measures different organisational operating risks.                                                    |\n| Impact      | A higher degree of financial leverage denotes higher risk in the business and vice versa.                    | Higher operating leverage indicates higher operating risk for the business and vice versa.               |\n| Preference  | Highly preferred.                                                                                            | No preferred too much.                                                                                   |\nFinancial Leverage ExampleHere is an example that will help you understand how financial leverage works.Suppose Company XYZ wants to acquire a valuable asset worth Rs. 10,00,000. Now, the company faces a choice between two methods of financing: equity or debt.If Company XYZ opts for the equity route, it means they are willing to give away a part of their company to own the asset. In this case, they will fully own the asset from the beginning, and there won't be any interest payments involved. If the value of the asset appreciates by 40%, the asset's new value would be Rs. 14,00,000, resulting in a profit of Rs. 4,00,000 for the company. Conversely, if the asset's value depreciates by 40%, the asset would be worth Rs. 6,00,000, leading to a loss of Rs. 4,00,000 for the company.Alternatively, Company XYZ could choose a different path by financing the asset using a combination of common stock and debt in a 50/50 ratio. In this case, if the asset appreciates by 40%, its value would also become Rs. 14,00,000. It can then use the profit to pay off the debt faster and own the asset completely. Limitations of Financial LeverageThere are a few limitations to using the financial leverage method in your business. They are:There is no guarantee of returns on investment. If anything goes haywire, you still have to repay the amount you borrowed.If you default or fall behind in paying the loan or credit, it can damage your credit capability among lenders.Borrowing money from relatives or family can strain personal relationships if things in the business don't work out.If you borrow money against your personal asset, such as a house or car, there is a risk you will lose it if you default.Advantages of Financial LeverageEven if the risks of financial leverage are high, there are some advantages to this method. They are:If you borrow money, you can invest it in the business sooner or later.Investing the borrowed money can help in the growth of your business as well as your wealth for a longer period.Your investments also have the potential to improve your quality of life.ConclusionIntroducing financial leverage in your business can help you grow your business and wealth faster. The borrowed money can be utilised to invest in new projects, fund ongoing projects or grow the capital structure of the firm, helping you get higher returns after a certain tenure. However, before introducing this method in your firm, make sure to have a chat with professionals about how effectively this method can be implemented in the business and how you can grow your business without many risks.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is financial leverage and its formula?Financial leverage is the utilisation of loans by firms or individuals to fund initiatives or buy more assets for the business.

        "headline": "What is Miscellaneous Expenses? Examples And List",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "While deciding on a budget for a company, it is extremely important to consider all the costs that the company might have to bear. One of the important aspects that must be considered in this regard is miscellaneous expenses. The company incurs miscellaneous expenses during a specific accounting period. These are small values and are not important enough for a separate ledger account. Keep reading to find out all you need to know about miscellaneous expenses, along with examples.What are Miscellaneous Expenses?Miscellaneous expenses can be defined as a cost that generally does not fit any specific account ledger or tax category. These are typically minor transactions that are identified and tracked by the companies. They typically include small and non-recurring expenses like fees, items bought for office or business trips, etc. These expenses are often unforeseen or irregular and do not usually fit budgetary allocation. As they are unexpected, they can vary from month to month and year to year. Though they are insignificant individually, together, they can add up and impact an organisation's budget over time. Miscellaneous costs are a part of a company's operating costs. Given their unpredictable nature, allocating certain portions of the budget for handling miscellaneous costs is important. Therefore, while budgeting, companies must allocate funds to cover all the necessary costs without going overboard or overspending with allocations.Businesses need to see these costs more clearly so that they can manage their money better. These expenses can help companies identify the areas of potential growth or cost savings. Also known as sundry, out-of-pocket, general or incidental expenses, different companies refer to miscellaneous costs differently depending on the industry and context.There are various ways that you can use for managing miscellaneous expenses in a proper manner. This includes creating a miscellaneous category in the budget for meeting unforeseen expenses. Companies can create an emergency fund to reduce the financial impact of such unexpected requirements. Another way can be to keep track of the expenses in order to identify a pattern of the expenses for adjusting the budget accordingly. Companies need to prioritise expenses and control any unnecessary spending to reduce miscellaneous expenses. It is best to research and compare prices before purchasing for business purposes.Miscellaneous Expense in AccountingIn accounting, miscellaneous expenses are small transactions that usually do not fit any ledger's specified accounts. However, businesses must keep a record and account for it in their business ledger account. In case items under miscellaneous expenses increase in usage and size, they should be given their own account.Companies maintain different types of ledgers and journals for financial record-keeping and accounting purposes. Different types of income and expenses have their ledgers, including utility ledgers and sales ledgers for incoming and outgoing expenditures. This miscellaneous expense category is, however, given its own line on an income statement account for the purpose of clear and concise tax return filing. Companies can end up getting tax deductions on their miscellaneous expenses for business purposes as per tax regulations.Miscellaneous Expenses ExamplesMiscellaneous expenses depend on individual situations. Following are some scenarios to get a better understanding of miscellaneous charges:Scenario 1: Suppose XYZ company is a shoe manufacturer. The company bears different types of expenses, such as rent, raw materials, advertising, etc., that are regular expenses for the day-to-day operation of the company. This company received an order of 1000 customised shoes from ABC International. At the time of delivery, it was found out that a special logo was not pasted on 500 shoes. The company spends Rs. 10,000 extra for those special logos and sticks them on the 500 shoes. This additional Rs. 10,000 is known as a miscellaneous expense as it does not fall into the category of any regular expenditure, and it is a small amount. Therefore, while preparing the balance sheet, XYZ company classifies Rs. 10,000 under miscellaneous expenses.Scenario 2: Let's say ABC company recently had a product launch. However, the product did not turn out to be of good quality. Therefore, to address the customers' needs and to find out their problems, the company organises a special meet-and-greet event. The company incurs certain expenses in relation to the event. Some of these expenses include catering, booking a venue, etc. These expenses can be included in the miscellaneous expenses account.Miscellaneous Expenses ListMiscellaneous expenses are additional costs that a business incurs as they are not related to the core operation. Here is a list of some of the miscellaneous expenses that a company might have to incur:Repair and Maintenance: In case there is a need for any unexpected repairs or maintenance for company assets like machines or vehicles.Unforeseen Emergencies: These are expenses for unexpected events like natural disasters, medical emergencies, car accidents, etc.Travel Costs: These are incurred during travel and include baggage fees, tolls, parking, lodging, meals, etc.Professional Services: These include fees paid to lawyers, consultants, and accountants for their services. Professional Development Training: These provide employees with the necessary knowledge and skills to keep them updated.Marketing Expenses: These include activities in relation to advertising or for creating public awareness about the products and services that the company offers.Bank Charges and Fees: Companies have to incur charges for ATM withdrawals, wire transfers, overdraft fees, etc.Office Supplies: These are miscellaneous expenses for printer ink, stationery items and other small office supplies.Subscription and Membership Charges: Costs for subscribing to periodic publications or business-related courses fall under this category.Clothing or Job Uniforms: Expenses for providing clothes required for safety reasons.Job Search Cost: Expenses associated with finding and hiring new employees.Gifts and Donations: Costs incurred to purchase gifts for birthdays or weddings and donations for charity events.ConclusionThere are several advantages to tracking miscellaneous expenses.

        "headline": "Accrual Concept in Accounting: Meaning, Importance and Example",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Accruals within a business are significant processes that help ensure the company's financial statements properly reflect its financial health. Following the accrual concept means transactions are recorded even if payments for certain services have not been fully paid.In this article, we will give you a detailed analysis of the accrual concept in accounting, its importance, examples and journal entries and how it differs from the matching concept.What is the Accrual Concept?The concept of accrual is the recording of expenses or revenue that has been incurred or earned but still has not been recorded in the financial statements of the business. Accruals in the business can include different transactions, such as expenses incurred but not yet paid or unpaid invoices for any services provided.What is the Accrual Concept In Accounting?In accounting, the accrual concept is understood as journal entries, helpful at recognising expenses and revenues that are consumed or earned, respectively. In this case, cash amounts are either not fully paid out or received by the firm.The accrual concept in business is important, especially while creating financial statements as per the accrual basis of accounting. Within the double-entry bookkeeping process, any accrued expense is considered the liability of the firm and accrued revenue is considered business assets. Importance of Accrual ConceptUnderstanding the accrual concept is important for various reasons, especially since it helps in the accurate preparation of financial statements. Here are some points of significance of accrual accounting.Assessment of Business PerformanceThe performance of a business is assessed more accurately due to the application of the accrual concept. This is because accruals are portrayed in financial statements that indicate the financial health of the company. This happens due to the availability of information on accounts payable and receivable. Instant portrayal of where money is coming from and going out is expected in future reports, making performance assessment easy.Planning Future FinancialsAccrual accounting is important as it is implemented in the business in real time, making it easy for management to have a detailed overview of finances. It also allows the accountants to assess progress from previous financial years and compare it with the present to plan for the future on an appropriate budget.Accurate ResultsWhen accrual accounting is implemented in a company, it depicts a more accurate position of business finances. As debts and income of the firm are properly outlined, it helps the company manage its financials per business activity patterns.Implementation of the Matching PrincipleThe accrual method uses the matching principle method, an important factor in business accounting. In this case, expenses and revenues are reported in the same period and are 'matched' to determine profits or losses of that financial period.Accrual Concept ExampleHere are a few examples of accrual accounting methods followed within a business for an accurate business process.Sales AccrualsSuppose ABC Company, a service-based organisation, is working on a major project handled by PBC Company. As per conditions, the billing for this project will only be done after its completion. However, while working on the project, ABC Company can accrue earnings or revenue for the work that is completed to date, even though billing for the project is not issued by PBC Company. This is considered to be revenue accruals of ABC Company.Wages AccrualsConsider a scenario where an employer pays wages to its employees on the 20th day of the month for the hours they worked. In such a case, employers can accrue any additional wages earned from 21st day to the end of the month, ensuring full amount of expense on wages gets recorded in financial statements.Interest AccrualsFor instance, a lender issues a specific amount of loan to a company and sends an invoice every month to the borrower with details of interest owed. The borrower, in such cases, can record interest expense in advance for the receipts, thus specifying its accrued interest.Accrual Concept Journal EntryThe journal entry aspect for accruals in a business is based on two main rules. They are - Accrued expenses are debited.Accrued liabilities are credited.Let us consider a few examples to fully understand journal entries for accruals in a business.Suppose K Ltd. sells goods on credit to T Ltd. at an amount of Rs. 5,000. Hence, the journal entry will be - \n| 0    | 1                                                                               | 2   | 3                 | 4                  |\n|:-----|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----|:------------------|:-------------------|\n| Date | Particulars                                                                     | L/F | Debit Amount (Rs) | Credit Amount (Rs) |\n| nan  | T Ltd. A/C Dr.  To K Ltd. A/C  (Being goods sold on credit to T Ltd. by K Ltd.) | nan | 5000              | 5000               |\nHere is another example to understand journal entries.On January 1, 2023, KBC Ltd. invested Rs.1,000 in a 5-year FD at 5%. It will get the whole amount upon maturity, which will be on December 31, 2028, although interest will be recognised annually. Therefore, the journal entry for this is -\n| 0          | 1                                                                                                | 2   | 3                 | 4                  |\n|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----|:------------------|:-------------------|\n| Date       | Particulars                                                                                      | L/F | Debit Amount (Rs) | Credit Amount (Rs) |\n| 31.12.2023 | Interest Income A/C Dr.  To Accrued Interest  (Being accrued interest income received each year) | nan | 50                | 50                 |\nDifference Between Accrual and Matching ConceptThere are a few points of difference between the accrual concept and the matching concept in the accounting process. They are discussed as follows.The accrual concept refers to recording the transactions whenever they are incurred or earned, regardless of actual outflow or inflow of cash. On the other hand, the matching concept specifically focuses on recognition and recording transactions of expenses in business.The matching concept measures the aspect of profitability of a transaction for a specific period. Whereas, the accrual concept focuses on the economic reality of transactions rather than movement in cash.The purpose of the accrual concept is to ensure the financial statement of the firm gives a clear picture of its financial position and performance by recognising revenues when incurred. The matching concept, on the other hand, aims to align its expenses with the revenue it generates and ensures the financial statements reflect the true cost of generating such revenues.Example: In the case of the accrual concept, revenue for a service rendered in January is recorded in the same month, even if payment is received in March. In the case of a matching concept, A Ltd. sells a product in September, but the manufacturing cost is incurred in July. Thus, applying this concept, expense recognition is done in September, when the sale occurred.ConclusionOverall, appropriate application of the accrual concept is important in business as it helps you get an accurate picture of the business finances. Having an accurate financial statement helps the decision makers to make changes as per requirements, thus helping the business improve with time.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is the accrual concept?Accrual is the notion of recognising a cost or income that has been incurred or received but has not yet been shown in the company's financial statements. Even though payments for some services have not yet been made in full, accruals in the company are important because they ensure that the financial statements of the company accurately represent its financial health.How important accrual accounting is to enterprises?Accrual accounting is important for an enterprise in terms of accurately recording sales and purchases. Having the proper timeline for such transactions helps financial records to align with business activities and make changes as per business goals. What are the three major reasons for accrual accounting?Three major reasons to implement accrual accounting in the business are:Get an appropriate picture of company revenues and expenses during a specific accounting period.Accurate evaluation of the financial position, performance and health of the business.Get an insight into the organisational and operational changes of the business.What are the key features of accrual accounting?Some key features of accrual accounting are as follows:Recognition of revenue, irrespective of receiving the cash.Clear recognition and treatment of expenses for an accounting period.The carrying forward and ongoing evaluation of expenses that are not charged to income.Business expenses are matched against earned revenues.How does the accrual concept apply in practice?In practice, the accrual concept is applied when companies record their goods sold as revenue when it is only shipped to customers, and the customer has still not paid the money for the product."

        "headline": "What is Net Profit Ratio? Formula, Calculation, Example",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "Investors, accountants, and financial professionals often use the net profit ratio to find out about a company's financial health. It shows how companies use their assets to earn profits and generate value for their owners. This ratio can help businesses find new ways to improve their finances and maximise their efficiency. Keep reading to find out what the net profit ratio is, its importance, how to calculate it and how it is different from the gross profit ratio.What is the Net Profit Ratio?Net profit ratio, also known as net profit margin, measures a company's financial performance or profitability after taxes. It helps measure the company's profit to the total amount of money invested in the business. The net profit ratio reveals the remaining profit after deducting production costs, financing and administration from sales and income taxes.You can use the net profit ratio to determine the financial value of a company and its overall performance. If we need to explain it in simple terms, net profit margin is a ratio of net profit to the net revenue of a business. It is a good measure for comparing the results of a business with its competitors.What Does Net Profit Ratio Indicate?The net profit ratio is essential to a company's financial health. It helps measure a company's capability to keep its expenses under control. This helps in finding out how efficiently a company is spending their money. By tracking the net profit margin, a company can evaluate whether the current practices are working properly or not. As companies mention the net profit ratio as a percentage rather than an amount, it is possible to compare the profitability of two businesses even if their sizes are different. With the help of the net profit ratio, investors can evaluate whether a company's management is generating enough profit from the sales. The net profit ratio, however, is not an indicator of cash flow as it includes many non-cash expenses like amortisation, depreciation and accrued expenses. What is a Good Net Profit Ratio?A good net profit ratio varies from industry to industry. It also depends on the company's past performance. For example, anything between 0.5% and 3.5% in the retail sector can be considered a good net profit ratio. For other industries, however, these numbers might be extremely low. However, the reason why this percentage is common among food-related companies and retailers is because of high overheads.In general, however, a net profit ratio of 10% to 20% is considered average. It is, therefore, best to compare a company's net profit ratio with its previous year's net profit ratio to evaluate it and improve it if required. A good net profit ratio means that a company is selling its products at a higher price than its manufacturing and distribution costs. This is generally a result of low operation costs, efficient management and strong pricing strategies. However, a low net profitability ratio might be due to high operational costs, inefficient management, recession, technological disruption and poor pricing strategy.Importance of Net Profit RatioThe net profit ratio is possibly the most important evaluator of a company's overall profitability. It is a ratio expressed in percentage that helps measure net profit to revenue for a business segment or a company. This margin shows how much profit each sale generates after considering the business expenses involved in earning revenues. A large net profit margin means more of every rupee in sales is kept as profit.A good net profit ratio means that a company can effectively control its costs and provide goods or services at a higher price than its costs. The net profit ratio of a company also indicates its efficiency for cost-containment measures over a period of time.Significance of Net Profit RatioThe net profit ratio is a crucial financial metric that provides us with a report of a company's financial health by considering its expenses and revenue. This ratio helps evaluate whether a company has an effective pricing strategy and manages its expenses well.It helps companies to compare the profitability of a company for different accounting periods. This gives an in-depth understanding of whether their financial measures are doing well or not. It is useful to project a company's net income based on its revenue by tracking net profit ratio over time. This ratio is extremely significant when a company applies for a loan. Financial institutions assess their net profit ratio before deciding whether to grant them a loan or not. Banks prefer a company with a high net profit ratio as it proves that they likely have a strong cash flow and, therefore, a better probability of paying back their loan. Net Profit Ratio FormulaThe formula to calculate the net profit ratio is as follows:Net Profit Ratio = (Net Profit / Net Sales) x 100In this formula,Net Profit = Operating Profit – (Direct Cost + Indirect Expenses),Net Sales = Sales – ReturnsThis formula can be modified for use by a non-profit organisation by replacing net profit in the formula with net assets.Net Profit Ratio ExampleLet us assume that ABC company has sales of Rs. 10,00,000 and sales returns of Rs. 5,00,000. Its direct costs are of Rs. 1,00,000 and indirect costs are of Rs. 2,00,000. Then, what is the company's net profit ratio?The formula is Net Profit Ratio = (Net Profit / Net Sales) x 100However, to find this out, we need to find out the net sales of the company,The formula for this is,Net Sales = Sales - Returns                  = 10,00,000 – 5,00,000                  = Rs. 5,00,000Next is finding out Net Profit, the formula for which is,Net Profit = Operating Profit – (Direct Cost + Indirect Cost)                   = 5,00,000 – (1,00,000 + 2,00,000)                   = 5,00,000 – 3,00,000                   = 2,00,000Now Net Profit Ratio = (Net Profit / Net Sales) x 100                                      = (2,00,000 / 5,00,000) x 100                                      = 0.4 x 100                                      = 40%This means that the company has a net profit ratio of 40%.Net Profit Ratio CalculatorIn the formula, net profit is calculated by subtracting the total expenses from total revenues. The profit in the profit and loss account is calculated by deducting direct costs and indirect expenses from operating profit. Net profit percentage is calculated by dividing after-tax profit by net sales. It is the residual profit after recognition of income tax as well as the deduction of manufacturing, financing and administrative costs from sales.Net profit is the money the company makes after subtracting operational, interest and tax costs for a particular period of time. On the other hand, net sales can be arrived at by subtracting the sales returns, discounts and allowances from total sales. How to Improve Net Profit Margin Ratio?It is generally quite difficult to improve a company's net profit ratio. This is because they tend to pursue high-profit opportunities first, leaving the lower-margin sales for later. However, a good way to avoid such a trap is by pursuing economies of scale, which makes each additional sale less expensive.One of the steps you can take to accomplish it is purchasing in bulk, which lowers the cost of material per unit. Another method is to invest in product redesign and automation to reduce the cost of labourers for product assembling.Apart from that, businesses can increase sales, reduce sales or do both to get a competitive advantage. This, however, might involve spending more money. If you cut too many costs, it might result in undesirable outcomes like losses in quality, losing skilled workers or shifting to inferior materials. The best option for many businesses if they wish to reduce the cost of production without sacrificing quality is expansion. Difference Between Gross Profit Ratio and Net Profit RatioFollowing is a tabular representation of the basic differences between the gross profit ratio and net profit ratio:\n| 0              | 1                                                                                                                            | 2                                                                                 |\n|:---------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Parameters     | Gross Profit Ratio                                                                                                           | Net Profit Ratio                                                                  |\n| Definition     | Gross profit margin is revenue left after deducting costs related to product's raw material, manufacturing and distribution. | Net profit ratio is revenue left after deducting expenses, taxes, debts, etc.     |\n| Costs Included | To find gross profit ratio, we do not consider taxes, interest and other expenses.                                           | To find net profit ratio, we need to consider taxes, interest and other expenses. |\n| Indicator      | Not an accurate indicator of a company’s financial health                                                                    | Is an accurate indicator of a company’s financial health.                         |\nConclusionSeveral profitability metrics are available for investors to make better decisions. Net profit ratio is one of the most popular metrics among them. Anyone can assess a company's performance by going through the public income statement. However, it is best to consider not just a single metric to decide the company's standing. A holistic approach is good to remain ahead in this competitive market.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is a good net profit margin ratio?Good net profit ratio is a relative term as it might vary from industry to industry.

You can record this account while preparing your financial statement or balance sheet, which is accounted under the Fixed Assets head.Sundry Debtors Ledger Account FormatAfter completing the recording of your financial transactions using journal entries, you need to put the balances in general ledger accounts to get the closing value at the end of the financial year. In the case of sundry debtors' accounts, the format of the general ledger used to record and balance out the sum is given below:Sundry Debtors A/C\n| 0    | 1                                                | 2           | 3    | 4                                                   | 5           |\n|:-----|:-------------------------------------------------|:------------|:-----|:----------------------------------------------------|:------------|\n| Dr.  | Dr.                                              | Dr.         | Cr.  | Cr.                                                 | Cr.         |\n| Date | Particulars                                      | Amount (Rs) | Date | Particulars                                         | Amount (Rs) |\n| nan  | To Balance b/d  (opening sundry debtors balance) | ***         | nan  | By Cash Received from Debtors                       | ***         |\n| nan  | To Bills Receivable Dishonoured                  | ***         | nan  | By Bills Receivable Received                        | ***         |\n| nan  | To Credit Sales (if provided)                    | ***         | nan  | By Bad Debts                                        | ****        |\n| nan  | nan                                              | nan         | nan  | By Balance C/D  (closing balance of sundry debtors) | ***         |\n| nan  | nan                                              | *****       | nan  | nan                                                 | *****       |\nSundry Debtors ExamplesLet us take you through an example to help you understand how sundry debtors are accounted for.Imagine Mr. K, a business proprietor in the printing industry, who requires a supply of printing ink. To meet this need, he places an order with Mr. R, who operates a shop that sells printing supplies. As the transaction unfolds, Mr. K and Mr. R agree to a unique arrangement. Rather than making an immediate payment, Mr. K commits to settling the bill within 15 days from the date of purchase.This commitment from Mr. K signifies the birth of a debtor-creditor relationship between him and Mr. R. In simple terms, Mr. K transitions from being a cash-paying customer, which would classify as a current asset for Mr. R's business, to becoming an active debtor. The collective term for such debtors is often referred to as 'sundry debtors'. In this way, businesses like Mr. R's manage their accounts receivable, keeping track of customers who owe them money under agreed-upon terms.Sundry Debtors in Balance SheetIn a balance sheet, sundry debtors are accounted for in the 'Assets' section, listed under the fixed assets head. This acts as an asset to the business, and in the books of the company, it is listed on the asset side of the balance sheet.Sundry Debtors in Trial BalanceSundry debtors are considered as the assets of a business. In such a scenario, the amount of sundry debtors is always debited while recording the general ledger balances in a trial balance.Sundry Debtors Journal EntryTrade or accounts receivable generally arise in a business due to credit sales, which are considered as business revenue. Nonetheless, when the amount is due to be received by the firm, it becomes the company's asset.

        "headline": "Actionable Claim Under GST & TPA: Meaning, Types, Examples",
        "subheadline": "",
        "data": "In the complicated world of Indian law, \"actionable claims\" are a big deal. They matter a lot in things like taxes and business deals. This blog will explore actionable claims related to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Transfer of Property Act (TPA). First, let's see what actionable claims are with two examples.What is an Actionable Claim under GST?In the context of GST, an actionable claim refers to a claim to any debt, whether secured or unsecured, excluding lottery, betting, and gambling. GST treats actionable claims differently than other goods and services, with significant business implications.Examples of Actionable Claims1. Outstanding Invoices: Consider a scenario where a business has provided goods or services to a customer but has not yet received payment. The unpaid invoice represents an actionable claim for the supplier, subject to GST.2. Bank Loans: When a bank lends money to a borrower, it creates an actionable claim in the form of a debt. Interest charged on this debt is also subject to GST.3. Life Insurance Policies: A life insurance policy is an actionable claim in the realm of insurance. Upon the policyholder’s death or on other clauses, it assures the beneficiary of a sum of money. 4. Promissory Notes: A promissory note, under the Transfer of Property Act, is an actionable claim, as it assures to pay you a sum of money. Types of Actionable ClaimsAn actionable claim represents a legal right to demand something from another party, often involving monetary compensation. These claims can be broadly categorised into two primary types: Secured Actionable Claims and Unsecured Actionable Claims. Each type has its unique characteristics, implications, and legal standing. 1. Secured Actionable ClaimsSecured Actionable Claims are claims that are backed by a security or collateral. To explain it better, these claims have some assets or property attached to them that can be seized or liquidated if the debtor fails. The creditor gets a high level of security in these actionable claims.Here are a few common examples of Secured Actionable Claims:Mortgages: If you mortgage your property, the lender, commonly a bank, has a secured actionable claim against your property. If you cannot pay, the lender can liquidate your property by selling it to recover the outstanding debt. Auto Loans: Auto loans are similar to mortgages but are restricted to vehicles only. If you cannot pay the debt, the lender can seize the car to cover the incurring debt. Secured Business Loans: If you are doing business, you can borrow a loan using various assets. The lender can seize or sell the assets if any business fails to meet its repayment obligations. 2. Unsecured Actionable ClaimsIn contrast to Secured Actionable Claims, unsecured actionable claims do not have any specific collateral attached to them. These claims are based solely on the debtor's promise to repay the creditor. While they offer less security to the creditor than secured claims, they are common in various financial transactions and contracts. Here are a few examples of unsecured actionable claims:Credit Card Debt: Your credit card is a big example of an unsecured actionable claim without collateral. Based on your credit score, the credit card company offers you the credit money. However, they have nothing to seize if you fail to pay the bills. Your creditworthiness is affected only. Personal Loans: Similar to credit card debts, personal loans are also unsecured as they don’t have any collateral. While approving the loans, the lenders offer you the credit, depending on your repayment history and financial stability. Trade Credit: In business, suppliers often extend trade credit to their customers. This is an unsecured actionable claim, as the supplier provides goods or services with the expectation of payment later.Modes to Transfer Actionable ClaimsActionable claims can be transferred in two ways:1. By Assignment: The claimant transfers their rights in the actionable claim to another party, who becomes the new claimant.2. By Negotiation: This involves the negotiation of a negotiable instrument like a promissory note, where the claim is transferred to the new holder through endorsement.GST Scope and How Are Transfer of Actionable Claims TreatedActionable claims are considered “goods” under the CGST Act but have some special rules. They are only taxed when transferred, sold, or given away for a price. This means that GST is not charged on the debt itself but only on the supply of the right to recover the debt. This is because actionable claims are neither a supply of goods nor services as per Schedule III of the CGST Act.GST is levied only on the supply of actionable claims when they are like supply and not on the debt itself. The tax liability arises when the claim is assigned, sold, or disposed of for consideration.Meaning of Actionable Claim under Other Laws (TPA)Apart from the GST framework, actionable claims also hold significance under the Transfer of Property Act (TPA). In the context of TPA, an actionable claim is a claim to any debt or beneficial interest in movable property that can be enforced by legal action.An actionable claim is defined in the Transfer of Property Act (TPA), which deals with the transfer of properties in India. According to Section 3 of the TPA, an actionable claim means:A claim to any debt that is not secured by any of the following:Mortgage of immovable propertyPledge of movable propertyMortgaging of movable or immovable propertyA beneficial interest in movable property that is not in the possession of the claimant, either actually or constructivelyTransfer of Actionable Claims Under GST vs. TPAThe transfer of actionable claims under GST and TPA follows different legal and tax procedures. While GST governs the tax implications of such transfers, the TPA provides the legal framework for transferring actionable claims. It's essential to understand the nuances of both systems when dealing with actionable claims in various transactions.What Are Non-Actionable Claims with ExamplesUnder relevant laws, the claims that don’t qualify as actionable are non-actionable. One of the greatest examples is winning a lottery, as it is excluded from the definition of actionable claims under GST. ConclusionActionable claims are critical to Indian law, influencing everything from taxation to property transfers. Understanding their nuances under the GST regime and the Transfer of Property Act is essential for businesses and individuals, as these laws can significantly impact financial transactions and legal rights.Frequently Asked QuestionsQ1: Are actionable claims always subject to GST?No, actionable claims are subject to GST only when they are transferred for consideration. Unconditional gifts or gratuitous transfers are generally not subject to GST.Q2: Can you give an example of a non-actionable claim?Winnings from a lottery or bets placed on gambling are considered non-actionable claims and are not subject to GST.Q3: Under GST, what is the tax rate on the transfer of actionable claims?There are various factors on which the tax rate on the transfer of actionable claims under GST depends, as the transaction qualifies as a taxable supply or the applicable GST rate for the specific type of actionable claim. "

SUV category of vehicles with an engine capacity of 1,500 cc and length of more than 4,000 mm could be levied a 22% compensation cess.Carbonated fruit pulp/juice-based drinks may be levied a 28% GST.Exemptions may be granted for incentives paid to banks for RuPay debit cards and BHIM-UPI transactions and viability gap funding subsidies payments made to airlines for the regional connectivity scheme.Key expectations from the 48th GST Council meetingDecriminalisation of offences under the GST lawThe government had indicated in September 2022 that prosecution could be launched against the offenders under the GST law where the value of tax evasion or misuse of input tax credits exceeds Rs.5 crore. Hence, legal proceedings may be initiated against people contravening the GST law. Moreover, if their property value is less than the defined limit, it can never be attached for GST recovery. Now, a proposal will be tabled before the GST Council for a change in limit. It may be increased to Rs.20 crore. The GST Council may also remove such penal provisions already governed by the Indian Penal Code (IPC). It is understood that after that, one can find a reference to the IPC for levying penalties for a detailed list of offences under the GST law.If the GST Council approves the decriminalisation of the GST law at the 48th GST Council meeting, then the CGST Act will be amended. These amendments will be tabled before the Parliament during the winter session in December 2022. After this, the Union Territories and states will incorporate these amendments into their respective SGST laws.Setting up of an appellate tribunalThe Centre is having discussions and is planning to set up the Goods and Services Tax Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT) by December 2023. Hence, it needs a nod to proceed from the GST Council in the upcoming 48th GST Council meeting.The GSTAT shall be set up in different states if the GST Council approves. The primary bench will be in New Delhi. These benches will hear GST disputes arising in the respective states as currently, the absence of it has put pressure on the local courts to deal with disputes.The appellate tribunal will be headed by a Supreme Court judge or the Chief Justice of a High Court. Each state bench may have a judicial officer who can be a High Court judge. A senior tax officer who qualifies as a state or centre technical member must be appointed. Every state can have a maximum of five benches. Also, the state governments may be granted concessions while nominating the technical members, all of which need to be decided by the GST Council at the 48th GST Council meeting.GST rate changes for taxing health insuranceThe GST Council received a representation to reduce the GST rate on the sale of health insurance policies and renewals. Currently, it is taxed at 18%, and the new rate, if approved, could be 12%.Further, the GST Council may also look into the report of the Group of ministers formed for rate rationalisation measures. Further, the GST rate panel may clarify tax-related issues. SUV category of vehicles with an engine capacity of 1,500 cc and length of more than 4,000 mm could be levied a 22% compensation cess.Competition Commission of India as the anti-profiteering authorityThe GST Council must consider what role the Competition Commission of India (CCI) plays or its powers as the anti-profiteering authority under GST. It will reduce any ambiguity currently being faced by businesses in the industry.The CCI was given powers by the GST Council at the 45th GST Council meeting and was notified by the CBIC vide CGST notification number 23/2022 on 23rd November 2022. However, there are no industry-specific guidelines for calculating the price reduction extent warranted by the tax rate cuts. Thus, it will be challenging for the authority to ensure full compliance. Hence, GST Council’s intervention in this matter is essential at this point in time. Report on taxing online gaming and casinos is not on the agendaThe Group of Ministers (GoM) are yet to submit the report on imposing GST on online gaming. It may not be ready before the upcoming GST Council meeting. Recently, the GST Council member Shri Mauvin Godinho told the media that several issues on taxing online gaming still needed to be addressed.Earlier, there were media reports that there was an in-principle agreement by the committee to levy a 28% GST rate on the gross gaming revenue. However, many industry stakeholders were apprehensive about the high GST rate. The 48 GST Council meeting 2022 shall be the last one for this year and may also be the last one before the Budget 2023. Make sure to mark 17th December as the 48 GST council meeting date on your calendar, so you get all the important updates! Also, stay tuned to this space for the highlights and updates on the 48th GST Council meeting press release and the 48th GST Council meeting notification."

        "data": "Ever thought about what will happen if we do not segregate our financial transactions into debit and credit amounts? Well, first and foremost, you will not be able to prepare your financial statement, leading to no understanding of your business finances and others.So why take the risk of not preparing your financial statements accurately when you just need to follow a few simple steps using the trial balance method? Take a look at this article to get a comprehensive guide on trial balance, its importance, method of preparation and examples.What is Trial Balance?Trial balance refers to a part of a financial statement that records the final balances of the ledger accounts of a company. This statement comprises two columns: debit and credit. An organisation prepares a trial balance at the end of the accounting year to ensure all entries in the bookkeeping system are accurate.The term 'Trial Balance' is derived from the perspective that it acts as a test for fundamental entries in the bookkeeping but does not perform a full audit. It is the first step in checking or auditing business finances as it helps accountants to be sure that no mathematical error happens before proceeding with other complex financial statements.Why is the Trial Balance Prepared?After closing all general ledger accounts, the trial balance is prepared at the end of the financial year. It helps to record the income and expenditures of the business and easily complete the preparation of the balance sheet in the next step.Moreover, the trial balance is also prepared to detect any error in the mathematical calculation. A key objective of preparing a trial balance is to summarise the financial transactions while continuing with the business activities. It helps the business management to make necessary decisions regarding changes in the finances and business activities.Features of Trial BalanceBelow is a list of features that trial balance has, helping businesses to analyse and proceed with financial recordings accurately:It comprises a list of different accounts of general ledger balances, both debit and credit amounts.Preparation of trial balance allows a firm to check for mathematical accuracy of the general ledger balances.This statement is prepared at the end of the financial year.It is not a part of the final financial statements.Limitations of Trial BalanceEven though the trial balance is an important part of the financial statement providing significant financial details, it has certain limitations. Here they are:The trial balance may fail to detect errors when a journal entry contains an incorrect amount recorded in both accounts.Errors of omission may go unnoticed as some transactions may not be recorded in the journal, making it impossible for even a correctly balanced Trial Balance to reveal such omissions.Any missing journal entry in the ledger will not be reflected in the Trial Balance, making it challenging to spot such omissions.Correct amounts in journal entries might be misallocated under the wrong accounting category by the accountant, a mistake that the trial balance is incapable of identifying.How to Prepare a Trial Balance?Here is the process to prepare trial balances in your business:Firstly, close all general ledger accounts to get their closing balance at the end of the financial year.Prepare the worksheet of trial balance as per format. It must comprise the columns of account names and debit and credit amounts.Fill in the trial balance worksheet as per the balances of the accounts. Any assets or expense amount of the business is considered in the debit column, and any revenue or business liabilities amount is recorded in the credit column.Add values accurately in each column.Lastly, close the trial balance worksheet. You must remember that if your total amount of debit balance matches the total credit balance, then recordings in the trial balance have been done accurately. Differences in totals suggest either mathematical error or input error of the balances.Trial Balance RulesWhile preparing a trial balance, there is a set of rules you need to follow. They are as follows:Assets of the business must be put down in the debit column.All business expenses must be written down in the debit amount column.Every liability of the company must be recorded in the credit column.All revenue and business gains will be recorded in the credit column.Trial Balance FormatFollow this structure to understand the format of trial balance:Name of CompanyTrial Balance as on …………..

This is because the rate of interest needs to be paid back to the bank in 6-12 months, due to which it is considered a short-term loan. Thus, as it becomes a liability of the business, the recording of this transaction will be in the credit column.Carriage Outwards in Trial BalanceWhile recording carriage outwards in a trial balance, the amount must be written down in the debit column. Carriage outwards is considered as an expense of the seller that occurs while transferring goods to customers. Hence, it is considered a selling or indirect expense of the business and, thus, recorded in the debit column of the trial balance.Return Outward in Trial BalanceThe company deducts the money received from returns on purchases from the total amount spent. This is treated as an expense. Therefore, returns outwards are recorded as a credit balance on the trial balance.Difference Between Trial Balance and Balance SheetTo understand the difference between trial balance and balance sheet, check the table provided below:\n| 0                                                                                 | 1                                                                                                            |\n|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Trial Balance                                                                     | Balance Sheet                                                                                                |\n| This statement records the closing balances derived from general ledger accounts. | This records the balances of the company’s assets, equities and liabilities.                                 |\n| Not a financial statement.                                                        | This is a financial statement.                                                                               |\n| Mostly used for internal auditing and recording of transactions.                  | Mostly used to show shareholders, owners and the general public how to assess a business's financial health. |\n| Verifies if totals in credit and debit balances are the same.                     | Check if business assets are equal to the company's equities and liabilities.                                |\n| Can be recorded any time of the year.                                             | Recorded at the end of the financial year.                                                                   |\nConclusionTrial balance is a significant part of a company's accounting procedure. It acts as one of the pillars based on which the financial statements are prepared. Based on such financial statements, the monetary position and health of the business are checked, and decisions to make changes are taken. Overall, trial balance summarises the company's activities, helping to seamlessly proceed with other accounting systems.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is the purpose of a trial balance?Trial balance is used to simply finish the next phase of preparing the balance sheet by aiding in the recording of the company's income and expenses.Why is closing stock not in the trial balance?Unsold products from acquisitions made during an accounting period are represented as closing stock. The Trial Balance has already recorded the entire cost of the purchases. The closing stock would be tallied twice in the Trial Balance if it were included. Hence, it is omitted in trial balance preparation.Will opening stock appear in the trial balance?Yes. Opening stock always appears in the trial balance, and the amount is recorded in its debit column.How to prepare a balance sheet from a trial balance?Follow the process below to prepare a balance sheet from the trial balance:Prepare and adjust the balances in the trial balance.Eliminate any expense or revenue accounts as they are not a part of the balance sheet.Aggregate the amounts of the remaining account in two separate headings that is, 'Assets' and 'Liabilities'.Cross-check your entries in the balance sheet format to avoid any errors.Lastly, sum up the totals for both the 'Assets' and 'Liabilities' sections. If the two amounts match, then your balance sheet preparation is accurate. "

GSTAT is the forum of the second appeal under the GST laws and the first common dispute resolution forum between the Centre and States. All appeals against the orders in the first appeals issued by the Appellate Authorities under the CGST and SGST Laws lie before the GST Appellate Tribunal, common under both the Central and State GST Acts. Being a common forum, the GST Appellate Tribunal will ensure uniformity in the dispute redressal under GST and, therefore, in the implementation of GST across India. Furthermore, the delay in setting up these tribunals had burdened the Writ Courts, which had to take up more fact-based cases which could have been dealt with by the GSTAT. The GST Council recommended the rules around the appointment and conditions of the President and members of the tribunals. In September 2023, the Finance Ministry made further progress by notifying the constitution of 31 tribunals nationwide. The first set of these tribunals will begin to operate sometime between November 2023 and January 2024. Three tribunal benches are being set up in Uttar Pradesh, the highest number allocated for a state. Karnataka and Rajasthan have two benches each. Maharashtra and Goa have three benches together for hearing appeals, whereas Tamil Nadu and Puducherry have two benches together. Each of the northeastern states has one tribunal bench.In the 52nd GST Council meeting, the GST Council will deliberate on all technical aspects around setting up the GST Appellate Tribunals.Implementation of a 28% GST levy on Online GamingThe GST Council had fixed 28% GST for online gaming transactions on face value in the 50th and 51st GST Council meetings. There were certain rules defined for its implementation as well. Necessary amendments were needed in the Central GST and state GST laws. In this meeting, the GST Council may review if all the states have passed necessary law amendments by 1st October 2023.Other expectationsThe GST Council is also expected to go through the progress made by different states/UTs in amending the state GST laws for various recommendations passed in the past by the Council, such as removing provision on the mandatory GST registration for e-commerce sellers and e-way bill rules for the intrastate movement of gold and precious stones e-way bill for gold to mention a few. Reports also suggest that the GST Council may decide on reducing GST rates for all the millet products to the nil category. Further, the GST rate on health insurance for certain categories, such as senior citizens, may be reduced from 18% to 12%. The GST Council Fitment Committee rejected the proposal to reduce the GST rate on Electric Vehicles (EV) batteries from 18% to 5%, most likely bringing up this matter before the GST Council in this upcoming meeting.Furthermore, the GST Council may also pick up the taxability of personal guarantees given by directors to the bank against the credit limits or loans sanctioned to the company.Stay tuned in this space to learn more about the highlights, latest updates and news on the 52nd GST Council meeting."
